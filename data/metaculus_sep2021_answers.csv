Explanation: While microwaves generate heat and have been effective in killing various types of viruses, including some strains of coronavirus, there is limited scientific research specifically on the microwave disruption of COVID-19 virus particles. It is possible that microwaves could have some effect on the virus due to their ability to generate heat and disrupt cellular structures, but more studies are needed to determine the exact effectiveness and conditions required. Thus, the probability of microwave disruption of COVID-19 virus particles is estimated to be 50%."

577,2022-06-29 03:59:00,"If Russia invades Ukraine in 2022, when will the invasion be acknowledged by Russia or the UN?",9719,"Name of the identified expert: Geopolitical Analyst

My best guess is that if Russia were to invade Ukraine in 2022, there is a likelihood that Russia would acknowledge the invasion within a few days or weeks, possibly by the end of the month. However, the acknowledgment by the United Nations (UN) might take longer, potentially a few weeks to a couple of months, as it would involve diplomatic discussions and deliberations. Please note that the specific timing of such events is uncertain and subject to change.

Probability of Russia acknowledging the invasion within a few days or weeks: 70%
