    "question": "Will Twitter have a corporate credit rating in the \"C\"s or worse before July 2023?",
    "context": "Elon Musk is a technology company founder and business executive whose net worth, depending on the fortunes of the stock market, has often ranked him as the world\u2019s wealthiest person. He first made a fortune as a member of \u201cthe Paypal Mafia\u201d; today his companies include Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, OpenAI, and The Boring Company.  Twitter is a social media microblogging service with several hundred million users that is especially influential for journalists, academics, government officials and other elites. It has been perceived as both an important catalyst for pro-democratic uprisings and a cesspool of misinformation and hate speech, and has attracted significant attention from regulators.  On October 27, 2022, Elon Musk completed a $44 billion buyout of Twitter. Soon after this deal closed, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s downgraded Twitter\u2019s corporate credit rating two steps to B1 from Ba2, citing \u201cgovernance risk\u201d associated with Twitter\u2019s new ownership. (See also Moody\u2019s rating scale and definitions.)  As of November 2022, Musks brief tenure as Twitter\u2019s new head had been marked by massive layoffs, not only from such supporting roles as diversity, equity, and inclusion, but including significant numbers of engineers. According to a New York Times article from Nov 11, 2022:  > In Redbird, Twitter\u2019s platform and infrastructure organization, Mr. Musk shed numerous managers. The unit also lost about 80 percent of its engineering staff, raising internal concerns about the company\u2019s ability to keep its site up and running.  That article also reported, as a result of these layoffs, a ratio of 70 engineers to each product manager at Twitter. Separately, top compliance officers resigned, suggesting potential troubles with the FTC.",

For chat.openai.com (the web interface, ChatGPT), the uptime has been published since Feburary, with Feburary at 98.28%,  March at 99.39%, April at 99.96%, and 99.83% for May as of May 24, 2023.

    "question": "Will the United States default on its sovereign debt before July 1, 2023?",
    "context": "The U.S. debt ceiling is a statutory limit set by Congress on the amount of national debt that the federal government is allowed to incur. When the government approaches the debt ceiling, it must either seek an increase in the limit from Congress or take measures to reduce its borrowing.  In the past, the U.S. has come close to breaching the debt ceiling on several occasions, and in some cases, the government has temporarily suspended the limit or taken other measures to avoid default.  The US has failed to pay debt obligations on time on several occasions. This Reason article describes five cases which could be characterized as default, and this Congressional Research Service (CRS) report explores three of them in more detail. The most recent occurrence was the 1979 \"mini-default\", when a technical error led to the late payment to holders of Treasury securities. CRS says the following about the overall record of US debt repayment:  >The historical record appears not to support the contention that the U.S. government has had an unblemished payment record since its origin. Under any reasonable definition of default, the federal government defaulted in 1814. The Treasury Secretary of the time, Alexander Dallas, referred to \u201cevery sort of embarrassment.\u201d The current website of the U.S. Treasury notes that Secretary Dallas faced a \u201cbankrupt\u201d Treasury. The failure of the Treasury to pay interest on its securities due to Boston banks in 1814 represents an unambiguous default event.  Regarding the 1979 \"mini-default\" CRS says:  >Claims that payment delays to small investors holding Treasury securities in the spring of 1979 constituted a default or a \u201ctechnical default\u201d appear weaker. Delays affected only a relatively small proportion of Treasury securities and the federal government responded to mitigate the inconvenience suffered by those investors. The legal document setting out terms for Treasury securities contained no default clause.  According to Reuters, the deadline for a debt ceiling increase could come earlier than expected:  >The U.S. government's deadline to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling could be sooner than expected, raising the prospect of a short-term debt limit extension, analysts said on Tuesday.  >Goldman Sachs analysts said weak tax collections so far in April indicate a higher probability that the so-called \"X-date,\" when the government is no longer able to pay all its bills, would be reached in the first half of June. Analysts at Citi said they expected a short-term deal in June or July.  >The Treasury Department has warned that the federal government could reach the moment when it will no longer be able to meet its financial obligations as early as June 5, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast that moment would come sometime between July and September.",

    "context": "*This question is a successor to a previous set. The background has been adapted and updated from this original version.*  ---  Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to post messages (or \u2018tweets\u2019). The website has more than 300 million daily active users in early 2023, amassing a total of over 350,000 tweets per minute. On October 27th, 2022, Twitter was bought by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, for a total of $44 billion.  Since Musk\u2019s buyout, there have been massive layoffs across most parts of the company, including its engineering department. For example, in November 2022, Twitter slashed nearly half of its workforce, with further layoffs occurring in late December 2022.   These layoffs have raised the worry that Twitter may not be able to continuously offer its services and avoid prolonged outages. There are daily reports of minor Twitter outages submitted by users every day, but given the size of Twitter and its user base, these do not constitute global prolonged outages. However, the risk of a global outage of significant duration remains.

This offensive also bogged down quickly, and Russia's offensive ambitions narrowed into the summer until they were focused around the town of Bakhmut, where operations were being conducted largely by the \"Wagner Group,\" a Russian paramilitary force.  By fall, Bakhmut was a central focus of the war, with fighting in trench warfare conditions and heavy casualties.  On December 20th, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bakhmut to show support for the defenders. On January 6th, Russia launched a powerful assault on the adjacent town of Soledar. On January 16, Russian forces secured control of Soledar and began encircling Bakhmut.  After months of fighting Russia made incremental gains in Bakhmut, with the city administrative building allegedly falling to Russian troops in April.   On May 5, the head of the Wagner Group said that Wagner would withdraw from the battle because of lack of Russian support.

This change included the introduction of pricing for API usage, a significant departure from the previous practice of providing the API for free. This led to an outcry from both developers and users of third-party Reddit apps, as these changes could result in substantial costs for developers and the potential shutdown of many popular third-party apps.  The developer of the popular third-party app, Apollo for Reddit, Christian Selig, stated he would be liable for an annual cost of $20 million under the new terms. This revelation sparked widespread discontent among Reddit users, leading to a coordinated protest involving more than 8,000 Reddit communities, including some of the largest and most active, going dark. Some communities have pledged to remain private indefinitely until Reddit makes changes.  Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman, has remained resolute regarding the API changes, emphasizing in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session and internal memos that the company must proceed with the changes. This stance is perceived as part of Reddit's broader effort to increase profitability, especially given the company's recent layoffs and plans to break even next year.

    "context": "Libor, the floating rate used in all sorts of financial contracts from student loans to derivates, served its purpose for quite a while, but it brought down by abuse and manipulation by the British banks that set it. This became evident a decade ago when several people went to jail for manipulating Libor, sometimes so blatantly that it was hilarious. In recent years, financial authorities across the globe have been looking at ways to move away from Libor, and multiple solutions have been proposed.  In the US and other countries of the Americas, the overnight guaranteed funding rate (SOFR), is slowly replacing Libor. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a good alternative. However, it\u2019s significantly lower than Libor, as it is a rate for essentially risk-free loans secured by Treasury bonds, while Libor incorporates the credit risk of banks. Libor is now around three basis points (0.03%) above but historically it has been rather around 10 basis points (0.1%).  Contracts in SOFR are already incorporating extra costs to account for this difference, but there\u2019s uncertainty in the market.

    "context": "What is consciousness? I once asked my boss, a neuroscientist who tolerated my philosophical predilections, what he thought about the nature of consciousness.  He chuckled and said \u201cit doesn\u2019t exist\u201d.  Instead of trying to be cute and retort about self-defeating claims I asked what he meant.  He went on to detail how consciousness has been glorified, placed upon a pedestal, and that it simply cannot be everything that people say it is.    I still don\u2019t know what consciousness is. Nor do my colleagues in philosophy.  You might think that we can simply say that consciousness arises from the sophisticated physical organization of human brains.  This leads to the Hard Problem of Consciousness, a phrase which philosopher David Chalmers coined back in the 1990\u2019s.  Think about the most beautiful moment sunset that you have ever seen.  Now explain that experience in terms of neurons firing.  It seems to many that physicalism (roughly, the idea that the mind is just the brain) is poorly equipped to explain the subjective quality of our experience.   Fear not, we aren\u2019t going to get lost in philosophical ruminations. We are going to predate upon a bet made in 1998 between neuroscientist Christof Koch and philosopher David Chalmers.  One night after a conference Koch bet Chalmers \u201ca case of fine wine that within the next 25 years someone would discover a specific signature of consciousness in the brain.\u201d (pg. 26). The idea is that Koch and his team will find a neural correlate of consciousness (NCC) \u201ca minimal physical signature in the brain sufficient for a specific subjective experience\u201d (ibid).  That is, Koch\u2019s team hopes to discover a small set of neurons with intrinsic properties. \u201cIntrinsic properties could be, say, a neuron\u2019s pattern of electrical firing, or genes regulating the production of various neurotransmitters.\u201c (ibid).

    "context": "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner was a two-term president of Argentina from 2007 to 2015, following her late husband Nestor Kirchner's 2003-2007 term. After her party lost the 2015 presidential elections against Mauricio Marcri, she briefly retired from the public eye, quickly returning to lead the opposition. She led the 2017 election campaign as a candidate for the Senate for the Buenos Aires Province (where she came second, winning a seat for the minority). In 2019, despite speculations that she might run again as president, she made the surprising move of proposing Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez (no relation) as the candidate for the presidency, while she would join him on the ballot as VP, reasoning that a less polarizing presidential candidate would make for a more appealing ballot. The coalition they formed ended up winning the election, but the existence of factions with different views has led to some infighting and to the estrangement between the president and the VP.  Since the end of her second term, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has faced multiple legal charges. While some of these have been dismissed, last December a federal court found her guilty on one of them, sentencing her to six years in prison and disqualifing her from holding public office for life. She denies any wrongdoing and says the charges are politically motivated, describing the proceedings against her as law-fare, which political analysts in the region describe as a form of \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d involving politicians, the judiciary and the media, usually with a view to smearing leftist leaders as corrupt. Her political sector blames this smearing as the root of last September's assessination attempt, where a man managed to hold a gun against her head and pull the trigger twice.  Even though Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner will appeal the court's decision, which could take years to resolve, she announced that she wouldn't be running for any office in next year's elections, although this would leave Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner without immunity from arrest after leaving office. However, after this announcement was made, the political organizations that respond to Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner have been campaigning for her and clamoring for her to be president in numerous public appearances.  There is still time to define the candidates for this year's national elections. The deadline for coalitions to present their candidates is June 24th. After that, the candidates of each coalition will compete in Simultaneous Open Primaries held during August 13th, whose results will determine the candidates to compete in the National Elections held on October 22nd, where besides the office of president, members of congress will also be elected.",

(To put it another way, of the replications that were not inconclusive, 57% were successful replications.)  In another project, researchers attempted to replicate all experimental social science science papers (that met basic inclusion criteria) published in *Nature* or *Science* (the two most prestigious general science journals) between 2010 and 2015. They found a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 62% (i.e., 13 out of 21) studies, and the effect sizes of the replications were, on average, about 50% of the original effect sizes.

    "question": "Will the Arctic sea ice extent be lower on each day of 2023 compared to that of 2012?",
    "context": "Arctic sea ice extent refers to the amount of ice cover on the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas. The extent of Arctic sea ice varies seasonally, reaching a minimum in late summer and a maximum in late winter. The long-term trend for Arctic sea ice extent has been a decrease, with a record low being reached in 2012, when the sea ice extent shrank to 3.39 million square kilometers. Since then, the Arctic sea ice extent has continued to decline, although there have been some years with higher levels than others.   This decline has important implications for the climate overall, in part because of feedback mechanisms like the ice-albedo and methane feedback mechanisms.   Ice-Albedo feedback mechanism, according to a 2017 Scientific Reports paper is \u201ca key aspect of global climate change. In the polar region, a decrease of snow and ice area results in a decrease of surface albedo, and the intensified solar heating further decreases the snow and ice area\u201d.   Additionally, the methane release feedback mechanism has been called a central climate tipping point by The Royal Society:   > [S]ubstantial warming could destabilise methane (a greenhouse gas) trapped in ocean sediments and permafrost, potentially leading to a rapid release of a large amount of methane. If such a rapid release occurred, then major, fast climate changes would ensue. Such high-risk changes are considered unlikely in this century, but are by definition hard to predict. Scientists are therefore continuing to study the possibility of exceeding such tipping points, beyond which we risk large and abrupt changes.  These mechanisms (as well as further consideration) make monitoring of the arctic ice sheet extent important. According to the National Snow & Ice Data Center, the arctic sea ice extent throughout January 2023 has been below the record minimum year of 2012 for every day. This raises the possibility that 2023 may not just be a new minimum (aggregated over the year) but may instead indicate a drastic shift in furthering the decline of the arctic sea ice extent.",

    "question": "Does Omicron have a shorter generation interval than Delta?",
    "context": "The generation interval is the time taken from the moment a person gets infected to the moment they infect a second person. On a population level, and as each individual typically transmits to multiple people, this forms a distribution. Along with the effective reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections from a single infected person), the generation interval distribution can be used to estimate the rate of transmission, forecast future infections, estimate the effectiveness of control measures, and potentially estimate the timing of an outbreak's peak and its final size.  If two infectious diseases have the same reproduction number but one has a shorter generation interval then case numbers for that disease will rise and fall more quickly than for a disease with longer generation intervals. Similarly, if it is wrongly assumed that two diseases have the same generation interval when one is actually shorter then estimates of the reproduction number will be biased upwards. This may result in poor quality forecasts and impact the policy interventions implemented.  Estimation of the generation interval is complex as both it and the effective reproduction number may change over time, across locations, and within subpopulations. We can think of the generation interval as being composed of both an individual's infectiousness over time and their contacts with others. Both of these are likely to differ due to demographic factors (such as age) with an individual's infectiousness likely also being altered by the effectiveness of their immune system and characteristics of the disease itself. The number, and type, of contacts for infected individuals, are also likely to vary over time and this can be impacted by mitigation efforts leading to reductions in the estimated generation interval (such as contact tracing).  Finally, realised generation intervals may be dependent on the transmissibility of a disease with more transmissible diseases more rapidly depleting their local networks (such as households), and local (or global) high prevalence leading to an observed reduction due to competition effects between infectors.  There are several transmission distributions that are related to the generation time including the serial interval (which is the time between the onset of symptoms for an infector and an infectee) , and the test-to-test distribution (which similarly is the interval between the case report of an infector and an infectee). These distributions may be used as a proxy for the generation time due to the difficulty in estimating the generation time. However, both of these measures are subject to a range of additional biases especially for pathogens that can transmit before the onset of symptoms, such as COVID-19.",

Twitter is a social media microblogging service with several hundred million users that is especially influential for journalists, academics, government officials and other elites.

    "question": "Will the US Supreme Court declare the Indian Child Welfare Act unconstitutional?",
    "context": "The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), enacted in 1978, is a federal law designed to protect the best interests of Native American children and promote the stability of their tribes and families.   The establishment of the ICWA came as a response to a painful legacy of the US government separating Native American children from their families and communities. For much of the Nation's history, the US federal government's policy towards Tribes was one of assimilation. The government aimed to encourage assimilation by relocating Native American children to boarding schools. This pattern persisted into the mid-20th century, with state-court proceedings deeming children neglected or abandoned without taking their cultural background into account, resulting in placements with non-Native American families. Studies found that \"large numbers of Native children were being separated from their parents, extended families, and communities by state child welfare and private adoption agencies.\"   Congress passed the ICWA to address these historical injustices and protect the interests of Native American children and their cultural heritage. Recognizing the unique cultural and social dynamics within Native American communities, the ICWA establishes minimum federal standards for the removal, placement, and adoption of Native American children in state child custody proceedings. It prioritizes keeping children within their tribal community by mandating that preference be given to extended family, tribal members, or other Native American families when placement decisions are made. Additionally, the ICWA requires state courts to collaborate closely with tribal courts to ensure that the rights of Native American children and their families are respected and preserved.  *Haaland v. Brackeen* is a pending Supreme Court case brought by the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana that seeks to declare the Indian Child Welfare Act unconstitutional. The plaintiffs argue \"that ICWA 'flouts the promise of equal justice under the law' by treating Native American children differently.\"  The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on November 9, 2022.  According to SCOTUSblog:  >Native American tribes call the law \u201cone of the most important pieces of federal Indian legislation ever enacted,\u201d and they warn that a ruling in favor of the challengers \u201cwould work profound harm on Indian children and Tribes.\u201d But Texas, one of the challengers, argues that ICWA \u201chas not achieved its stated ends of improving stability and security among Indian tribes,\u201d so that Native American children covered by ICWA \u201cremain at a greater risk for abuse and neglect than other children.\u201d  Four hundred ninety seven tribes submitted an amicus brief supporting ICWA as an \"appropriate exercise of Congress's authority that directly supports] tribal sovereignty and self-government and furthur[s] the best interest of Indian children.\" The tribes warned that overturning ICWA would \"threaten to rewrite the relationship between Congress and hundreds of Federally Recognized Tribes.\" Ruling that the ICWA is unconstitutional could have widespread ramifications, with some legal scholars warning that such a ruling could [call into question hundreds of treaties between the federal government and sovereign tribal nations.",

    "question": "Will the statutory debt limit be increased or suspended for at least 30 days in the United States before 2024?",
    "context": "The debt limit or debt ceiling in the United States, first established in 1917, sets a limit on the amount of money the US Treasury can borrow. As the US typically borrows to pay prior obligations, reaching the debt limit also limits the ability of the Treasury to fulfill debt obligations, risking default. When the debt limit is reached the Treasury will typically undertake extraordinary measures to avoid default as long as possible. Both debt held by the public and debt held by the Federal government (for example, debt owed to the Social Security trust fund).  To avoid default the US has periodically increased the statutory debt limit or temporarily suspended it. Suspensions of the debt limit typically include an increase to the statutory debt limit to match the outstanding debt on the day the suspension ends. The Treasury publishes a Daily Treasury Statement (DTS) containing data about the current statutory debt limit and the outstanding debt subject to that limit. A chart of the last three years of the statutory debt limit and the debt subject to limit is below, with more details here.    The US has failed to pay debt obligations on time on several occasions. This Reason article describes five cases which could be characterized as default, and this Congressional Research Service (CRS) report explores three of them in more detail. The most recent occurrence was the 1979 \"mini-default\", when a technical error led to the late payment to holders of Treasury securities. CRS says the following about the overall record of US debt repayment:  >The historical record appears not to support the contention that the U.S. government has had an unblemished payment record since its origin. Under any reasonable definition of default, the federal government defaulted in 1814. The Treasury Secretary of the time, Alexander Dallas, referred to \u201cevery sort of embarrassment.\u201d The current website of the U.S. Treasury notes that Secretary Dallas faced a \u201cbankrupt\u201d Treasury. The failure of the Treasury to pay interest on its securities due to Boston banks in 1814 represents an unambiguous default event.  Regarding the 1979 \"mini-default\" CRS says:  >Claims that payment delays to small investors holding Treasury securities in the spring of 1979 constituted a default or a \u201ctechnical default\u201d appear weaker. Delays affected only a relatively small proportion of Treasury securities and the federal government responded to mitigate the inconvenience suffered by those investors. The legal document setting out terms for Treasury securities contained no default clause.  Partisan standoffs over the debt limit have at times caused uncertainty in the financial markets. In 2011 S&P downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA+ after the debt ceiling crisis that year.",

However, President Erdo\u011fan suggested that it may be held on May 14, 2023 instead, which has been confirmed in late January 2023. Erdo\u011fan has been president of T\u00fcrkiye since 2014, having previously served as Prime Minister. This election is crucial because Erdo\u011fan is aiming to extend his 20-year rule in elections that will decide not just who leads T\u00fcrkiye but how it is governed, where its economy is headed and what role it may play to ease conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.  This election has been called the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Important\u201d by Bloomberg, as there is a risk that Erdo\u011fan will not concede a potential election defeat and stay in power. Just in 2019, in Istanbul\u2019s municipal election, \u201cthe opposition candidate, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, won a landslide victory over his rival. The governing Justice and Develop\u00adment Party (AK Party) has arguably suffered its most severe defeat since coming to power in 2002,\u201d suggesting that the possibility of an electoral defeat is higher than may be expected. This is against the backdrop of some polls showing several opposition candidates having sizable support that may translate into electoral victory.  With some analysts calling T\u00fcrkiye a \u2018one-man rule\u2019 through the erosion of democratic institutions, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s actions in the case of an electoral defeat could be decisive in setting the path for T\u00fcrkiye going forward.  Further, the constitutionality of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s third potential term has been challenged: The opposition declares Erdogan\u2019s candidacy \u201cunconstitutional\u201d while the Turkish president says his path to run for a third term is \"clear.\"  > The argument swirling around the presidential election, which is due to be held alongside a parliamentary vote on May 14, centers on Article 101 of the Turkish Constitution. The eight-paragraph clause states that a presidential term runs for five years and a candidate can be elected for a maximum of two terms.  > The constitution, therefore, appears to rule out an Erdogan candidacy.  > His supporters back the legality of his candidacy by arguing that constitutional changes introduced in a 2017 referendum, which came into force in the following year\u2019s election, mean Erdogan\u2019s first, post-2014 term does not count.",

Carroll first spoke about the allegations in 2019, during Trump's presidency, and filed a defamation lawsuit against him in November 2019 after he denied the allegations and accused her of lying to boost sales of her forthcoming book. The defamation lawsuit stalled in the courts for years and has yet to reach trial.  In 2022, New York lawmakers passed the state's Adult Survivors Act, which provided sexual abuse victims a one-year window to sue attackers for assaults that occurred years earlier. This law enabled Carroll to file a second lawsuit against Trump in November 2022, accusing him of both rape and defamation for denying the assault took place. The second lawsuit, seeking damages and a retraction of his denial, is now being presented in a New York City federal courtroom under the supervision of US District Judge Lewis Kaplan. The proceedings began on April 25, 2023, and both sides rested their cases on May 4th.  For Trump, a loss in the defamation case could lead to financial damages and further damage his reputation. Moreover, an unfavorable outcome in the rape case could potentially validate Carroll's allegations and add to the controversies surrounding Trump's personal conduct. Losing the cases could also have broader implications, as it could embolden other accusers to pursue legal action and weaken Trump's political influence moving forward.",

Karen Ross, which will have massive near-term impacts on the welfare of farmed animals raised in the worst conditions.Proposition 12 was a California ballot proposition that expanded upon California's already existing ban on caged farming systems (egg-laying hens kept in battery cages and pregnant sows kept in gestation crates). Under Proposition 12, not only would production of animal products made under intensive caged farming systems be illegal in the state, but so would the sale of such products (regardless of where they were made).The National Pork Producers Council is hoping that the Supreme Court will find California's law in violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause, while California is hoping that the court will consider banning caged farming a legitimate reason to burden interstate commerce and thus uphold their law.Will the Supreme Court overturn California's Proposition 12 in National Pork Producers Council v. Ross by the end of 2023?This question will resolve as Yes if before January 1, 2024, the US Supreme Court rules in National Pork Producers Council v. Karen Ross that California's Ballot Proposition 12 is unconstitutional. If SCOTUS delivers a mixed ruling that only part of Proposition 12 is unconstitutional, this question will resolve as Yes if that part is the more significant part, according to Metaculus' discretion. If SCOTUS remands the case to a lower court, this question will resolve as Yes if the final outcome of this case, or a successor case comprised of the merger of this case and others, finds that Proposition 12 is unconstitutional, and litigation for this case ends before 2024.

In crisis situations, these programs are vital for restoring confidence in the financial system, preventing contagion, and mitigating systemic risks by offering temporary liquidity support and stabilizing credit conditions.  One mechanism involves extending credit through the Fed's liquidity facilities to temporarily support various market participants and institutions during financial stress, ensuring proper functioning of credit markets and fostering overall economic stability. After Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in early March 2023, borrowing from the Federal Reserve\u2019s backstop facilities surged, totaling $154 billion for the week of March 13 across all liquidity facilities.

Silicon Valley Bank was one of the most prominent banks in Silicon Valley, having many start-ups and venture capitalists as its clients. As such, there has been speculation about the size of the negative impact of the SVB closure on start-ups and venture capitalists.   > The closure of Silicon Valley Bank has impacted startups and venture capital firms.

One further concern is that of contagion, the worry that the collapse of a single bank spreads financial distress to other banks systemwide. While large-scale contagion fears are at the moment not seen as very likely, there is significantly more concern about contagion risks for similar banks operating in Silicon Valley.

First Republic has aimed to calm investors by claiming that their \u201cliquidity and deposits remained strong\u201d and that it had a \u201cvery well diversified deposit base\u201d.

Artificially low prices from failing to provide for negative externalities on animal welfare, worker welfare, and ecological damage allow meat producers and companies to consistently under-price their goods.\u00a0  As plant based meat companies grow and are able to produce at scale, costs of production decrease and a virtuous cycle begins where lower prices draw larger numbers of consumers, which in turn allows for more efficiently scaled production.

In an outbreak report on 23 April, the World Health Organization stated that 12 countries have reported at least 169 cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children. The age range of cases is 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen of the children have undergone liver transplants and at least one has died. None of the viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) have been detected in any of the 169 cases.  The United Kingdom has had the greatest number of reported cases so far, with 108 cases as of 21 April according to the UK Health Security Agency.  77% of cases have tested positive for adenovirus. None of the confirmed cases is known to have received a COVID vaccine.   In the United States, the state of Alabama was the first to report cases. All nine of the reported cases have tested positive for adenovirus according to the U.S. CDC. Five of these were sequenced, and adenovirus type 41 infection was identified in all five. Adenovirus type 41 is known to commonly cause pediatric acute gastroenteritis, but is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.  Currently the leading hypothesis for the causative agent involves adenovirus, with either an already-circulating variant severely impacting immunologically naive young children or there being a new variant with a more severe clinical profile.  The former may be the result of less social mixing during the COVID pandemic.  However, public health officials have emphasized that other hypotheses have not been ruled out. Other hypotheses include COVID infection or an unidentified toxin. Some have suggested COVID vaccination may be a cause and a recent paper has found that mRNA vaccine can enter a human liver cell line in vitro: \"Our results indicate a fast up-take of BNT162b2 into human liver cell line Huh7, leading to changes in LINE-1 expression and distribution.\"",

At the beginning of the year, the index stood at $101.46 reaching a 2023-high of $115.10 in early February. However, since the beginning of March, the price has crashed from $109.33 on March 1 to $92.22 on March 10 on the basis of sector-wide concern over financial contagion from recent bank collapses:   In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by US banking regulators  > Silicon Valley Bank was shuttered by US regulators on Friday after customers raced to withdraw $42bn \u2014 a quarter of its total deposits \u2014 in one day and a failed effort to raise new capital called into question the future of the tech-focused lender. With about $209bn in assets, SVB has become the second-largest bank failure in US history, after the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual, and marks a swift fall from grace for a lender that was valued at more than $44bn less than 18 months ago.  This comes a few days after crypto bank Silvergate shut down:   > Silvergate, the San Diego-based regional lender that transformed itself into a go-to bank for the crypto industry, plans to wind down operations in the face of turmoil in digital currency markets. Citing \u201crecent industry and regulatory developments\u201d, Silvergate on Wednesday announced that a \u201cvoluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward\u201d. The disclosure sent its stock down more than 30 per cent in after-hours trading to $3 a share. In the past few years Silvergate had developed into the largest cryptocurrency bank in the US, attracting as much as $14bn in customer deposits and reaching a stock price of more than $200 in late 2021.  This raises the fears of more widespread contagion risk in the US banking sector, though a 2008-like collapse is seen as unlikely. As the Washington Post reports:  > With $209 billion in assets, the [SVB] was just one-eighteenth the size of JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest. Still, Wall Street was rattled by SVB\u2019s abrupt end, the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history, after Washington Mutual in 2008.  > Share prices of the industry\u2019s five largest players \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs \u2014 fell heavily in SVB\u2019s final days. BofA was down nearly 12 percent in the past five trading sessions.  The index closed at $101.47 on January 3, 2023.",

    "context": "In recent months there have been dozens of reported cases of severe hepatitis in young children in which the cause is of unknown origin.  In an outbreak report on 23 April, the World Health Organization stated that 12 countries have reported at least 169 cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children. The age range of cases is 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen of the children have undergone liver transplants and at least one has died. None of the viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) have been detected in any of the 169 cases.  The United Kingdom has had the greatest number of reported cases so far, with 108 cases as of 21 April according to the UK Health Security Agency.  77% of cases have tested positive for adenovirus. None of the confirmed cases is known to have received a COVID vaccine.   In the United States, the state of Alabama was the first to report cases. All nine of the reported cases have tested positive for adenovirus according to the U.S. CDC. Five of these were sequenced, and adenovirus type 41 infection was identified in all five. Adenovirus type 41 is known to commonly cause pediatric acute gastroenteritis, but is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.  Currently the leading hypothesis for the causative agent involves adenovirus, with either an already-circulating variant severely impacting immunologically naive young children or there being a new variant with a more severe clinical profile.  The former may be the result of less social mixing during the COVID pandemic.  However, public health officials have emphasized that other hypotheses have not been ruled out. Other hypotheses include COVID infection or an unidentified toxin.",

    "context": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is a key monetary policy-making body in the United States responsible for implementing and overseeing the country's monetary policy. The FOMC is composed of 12 members, which includes the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and five of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. The Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Jerome Powell also serves as the Chair of the FOMC.  The primary responsibility of the FOMC is to set monetary policy in order to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. To achieve these goals, the FOMC engages in open market operations, which involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities in order to influence the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. The FOMC also sets the target range for the federal funds rate and communicates its policy decisions to the public through press releases and the Chair's press conferences. As a result, the decisions made by the FOMC have a significant impact on the U.S. economy and financial markets, making it an important focus of attention for economists, investors, and policymakers.  The next FOMC meeting will be March 21-22.   FOMC statements significantly affect market volatility.  For example, early in March 2023, observers expected the FOMC to raise interest rates by 0.25 points. Following Mr. Powell's March 7 remarks before the US Senate, markets began to price in a 0.5 point increase, with the S&P 500 falling 1.5%",

Specifically, we find that the Governor sexually harassed a number of current and former New York State employees by, among other things, engaging in unwelcome and nonconsensual touching, as well as making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women. Our investigation revealed that the Governor\u2019s sexually harassing behavior was not limited to members of his own staff, but extended to other State employees, including a State Trooper on his protective detail and members of the public. We also conclude that the Executive Chamber\u2019s culture\u2014one filled with fear and intimidation, while at the same time normalizing the Governor\u2019s frequent flirtations and gender-based comments\u2014contributed to the conditions that allowed the sexual harassment to occur and persist.

Nevertheless, sometimes ships and airplanes of rival countries find themselves in very close proximity in the course of proving some point or other. The United States Navy, which frequently transits through disputed zones to contest \"excessive\" territorial claims, is particularly often on the wrong end of what it calls \"unsafe and unprofessional incidents\".    Occasionally, such incidents escalate from close intercepts and tense standoffs to outright physical collisions. In 1988 a Soviet military vessel intentionally rammed the cruiser *Yorktown* in the Black Sea in what has been called the last incident of the Cold War. There were several low-speed collisions between stalking submarines of Russia and the United States in the 1990s. Most notoriously, in 2001 a hot-dogging Chinese fighter pilot accidentally collided with a US Navy surveillance aircraft he was intercepting, leading to an emergency landing and a hostage-like standoff.    The invasion of Ukraine has started a new and more dangerous era in Russian-Western relations, marked by a return to Cold War levels of rhetoric and signaling. Indeed, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the situation may be more dangerous than during the height of the Cold War, for the lack of agreed-upon rules and restraints.

The Institute for Progress said the following in January 2022 (at the peak of the Omicron wave) about the issue with FDA's conservative approach:  > The United States doesn\u2019t have enough rapid tests. The root cause of this shortage is that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn\u2019t have an appropriate framework for thinking about tradeoffs during an emergency ... Rapid tests provide a key example of where the FDA has treated clinical trial data as necessary when other data should be sufficient for authorization during a public health emergency. Despite the broad benefit to the public of having rapid tests widely available, their supposed individual inferiority to PCR has kept almost all of them off the market.

The objects included:  - An object about the size of a small car shot down over sea ice near Dead Horse, Alaska - A cylindrical object brought down by US fighters over Canadian territory - An octagonal object shot down over Lake Huron  The US has not identified the origin or function of the objects, but has ruled out an extra-terrestrial origin. A White House spokesperson attributed the unprecedented activity to the US more closely monitoring US airspace following the discovery of the Chinese balloon.  On February 12th, China said it was preparing to shoot down an unknown flying object near its coast.  On February 14th, Moldova shut down its airspace to investigate reports of a balloon-like object in the sky, and Romania scrambled fighters to pursue a suspected balloon in the country's airspace.

The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in September 2022. Fraser's performance was highly praised and the film received a six-minute standing ovation at the festival.

Security Council meeting on maritime security.  The sea is known by different names in the countries surrounding it, primarily China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Each of the nations has asserted territorial claims over portions of the sea and its islands, claims which overlap. What is at stake is the control of the busy fishing and shipping region, as well as the vast estimated oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea floor.  The Spratly Islands compose some of the most hotly contested territory. The 14 islands and around 100 reefs and atolls are occupied by military personnel from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  Disputes over the South China Sea date back to the 1940s, and continue to this day. China has emerged as the most aggressive claimant, and has built military fortifications, airstrips, and artificial islands in the sea.  In July 2016, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ruled in favor of the Philippines that China had no historical right to its claimed territory, typically known as the \"nine-dash-line\" map. Neither China nor Taiwan has accepted the ruling.  And over the past five years, the risk of armed conflict has risen as various states have asserted and attacked claims to contested waters and island chains more strongly in response to China\u2019s increasing dominance and the growing involvement of the United States and its allies. In an incident in July 2021, China\u2019s military chased a U.S. warship from an area that it claims in the South China Sea, a statement the U.S. Navy called false.  Comments from world leaders suggest that the territorial disputes in the sea could erupt into armed conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken - at the August 2021 U.N. Security Council meeting - responded to China\u2019s increasingly assertive claims to parts of the South China Sea, despite the ruling of an international tribunal five years ago rejecting its claims, by warning that conflict there or in any ocean \u201cwould have serious global consequences for security and for commerce.\u201d  China\u2019s deputy ambassador, Dai Bing, shot back by accusing the United States of becoming \u201cthe biggest threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea\u201d and calling its \u201chype\u201d in the Security Council \u201centirely politically motivated.\u201d The rhetoric appears to not have escalated since this exchange, yet tensions in the region remain high.",

Their concept of operations apparently involved rapidly taking the capital, deposing the government, and largely completing the country's conquest before Western countries could co-ordinate on a reaction. By April, after fierce Ukrainian resistance and serious deficiencies in Russian military preparedness defeated this plan, Russia shifted focus to the Donets Basion (Donbas) region in the country's east, where conditions were more favorable. This offensive also bogged down quickly, and Russia's offensive ambitions continually narrowed into the summer until they were focused ultimately around the town of Bakhmut, where operations were being conducted largely by the \"Wagner Group\" private army under Yevgeny Prigozhin instead of by the regular Russian army.  By fall, Bakhmut was described as an obsession for Russia and a \"meat grinder\" into which its best forces were being wastefully thrown. Nonetheless, the Bakhmut offensive continued, with some analysts speculating that it was essentially a propaganda operation designed to provide Russian President Putin with a \"victory\" to offset mounting defeats, or even motivated by Prigozhin's personal financial interests.  On December 20th, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bakhmut to show support for the defenders. On January 6th, Russia launched a powerful assault on the adjacent town of Soledar, where Ukrainian officials acknowledged the situation was \"difficult.\" As of January 10th, there were competing claims about whether Soledar had fallen or would fall, and whether this portended a larger Ukrainian defeat over the coming days.",

    "context": "*Related Question on Metaculus:*  * Will Ukraine receive a modern main battle tank from a NATO country before 2024?  ---  NATO countries have sent a variety of military equipment to Ukraine in support of its defence against the Russian invasion. This includes drones such as the Bayraktar TB2, anti-tank weapons like the NLAW, artillery and long-range rocket systems like the HIMARS, and air-defence systems like the Patriot systems.  Poland has also sent over 200 Soviet-designed T-72 main battle tanks. However, Ukraine has reiterated its request for modern/NATO main battle tanks. Main battle tanks (MBTs) are armored fighting vehicles designed for front-line combat, characterized by heavy armor, high mobility, and powerful armament. NATO MBTs are generally considered to be some of the best in the world.  So far, the United Kingdom has committed 14 Challeneger 2 to Ukraine. However, this number is likely to be too low, as experts have estimated Ukraine to need at least 100 of such modern main battle tanks. This makes the US-made Abrams and the German-made Leopard the primary candidates, as there are large numbers available throughout Europe (in the case of the Leopard 2) and the US.   While some countries in possession of Leopard 2 MBTs have said they wanted to send them to Ukraine, Germany holds the license to these tanks, such that no transfer can happen without German consent. As of 22 Jan, 2023, the German government has indicated that they will not send Leopard tanks or allow transfer of them without the US also agreeing to send its M1 Abrams tanks, which the US has so far not done.  If this diplomatic stalemate is overcome, NATO countries may be able to supply Ukraine with many more NATO MBTs compared to the 14 that the UK has currently committed, potentially providing Ukraine with the heavy armour needed for the anticipated spring offensive.",

    "context": "Recently, there have dozens of reported cases of monkeypox outside of areas in sub-Saharan Africa (namely, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo) in which it is endemic. As of 12PM EST on 19 May, there are 75 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases across the UK, Portugal, Spain,  Canada, Sweden, Italy, and the US. According to a 19 May report by the the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, many of these cases are likely the result of community transmission since many do not appear to be linked to travel: > Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities, is considered to be high. The likelihood of transmission between individuals without close contact is considered to be low.  Monkeypox is closely related to but distinct from smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. The first case of monkeypox was diagnosed in in 1970 and in recent years the frequency and geographic distribution has increased in Central Africa and West Africa.  A recent systematic review finds that monkeypox has a less severe clinical presentation and is less transmissible than smallpox, but also that it has been evolving in recent decades to become of \"global relevance.\" The same article also reports a pooled case fatality rate estimate of 8.7%, with a point estimate of 10.6% for the Central African clade and 3.6% for the West African clade. As of 18 May, all sequenced monkeypox cases seem to be of the West African clade according to WHO. Prior to the ongoing 2022 outbreak, the majority of reported and suspected monkeypox cases were thought to be the result of animal-to-human transmission rather than human-to-human transmission. The secondary attack rate estimates of monkeypox pre-2022 are consistent with this \u2014 according to the aforementioned systematic review article: > More than half of the articles (9/16) reported an SAR of 0%, and this spanned the decades from the 1970s through 2010\u20132019. Similarly, over those same five decades, the SAR ranged from 0.3\u201310.2% in 6/16 articles . In the remaining article, a median SAR of 50% was reported in an outbreak among 16 households.  However,  monkeypox now seems to be spreading as a result of close contact between humans, perhaps in particular during sexual activities.  ---------------  ACAM200 and JYNNEOSTM (Imvanex) are two currently-authorized vaccines in the United States to prevent smallpox, and JYNNEOS (Imvanex) is also authorized specifically to prevent monkeypox . Effectiveness  against monkeypox is thought to be about 85%. The FDA approved JYNNEOS (Imvanex) in 2019 for \"the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection.\".  As of 19 May, the UK is offering Imvanex to healthcare workers at high-risk. As of 19 May, the US is not yet expanded the population to which it is offering a smallpox/monkeypox vaccine.",

In accordance with the need to \"take into account any new scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention,\" some BWC member states have proposed that there be established processes to systematically review developments in science and technology (S&T) under the convention. According to a UN study on the issue: > To address changes in biology and biotechnology, BWC States Parties have established processes to review developments in science and technology, including annual expert meetings on this topic. However, shortcomings are evident in the current approaches and many BWC States Parties have expressed support for a more systematic review of science and technology under the Convention. This support is further reflected in the results of a voluntary UNIDIR survey of all BWC States Parties in which 39 of the 42 respondents indicated support for a mechanism to systematically review science and technology of relevance to the BWC.  The purpose of this question is to understand whether processes to review developments in S&T will be agreed upon and will occur under the purview of the BWC, given political considerations and the fact that the decision would require unanimity.",

Often, the so-called \"core\" CPI is preferred, which excludes food and energy prices from the basket on the grounds that these prices are especially volatile and unrepresentative of the longer-term inflation level that the Federal Reserve targets.   The highest core CPI ever measured in a calendar year was 12.4% for 1980; with only one month of CPI statistics left to go, it is widely expected that 2022 will register the highest core CPI inflation since the early 1980s, exceeding the 5.0% peak in 1990 and coming in at roughly 6%.  Bloomberg News notes that:  > The path of US inflation in 2023 may have more surprises in store after a year in which consumers suffered the biggest cost-of-living hit in 40 years, spurring steep interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and spooking investors.

Since taking office, President Joe Biden has extended the payment freeze 4 more times. (CNET: Student Loan Payments Now Paused Until 2023: Everything to Know About the Latest Extension)  On August 24, 2022, the White House announced a final pause on federal student loan repayment through December 31, 2022, with borrowers expected to resume repayments in January 2023. As part of the same announcement, President Biden directed the Department of Education to provide up to $10,000 in debt cancellation to non-Pell Grant recipients and up to $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients.  On October 21, 2022, in the case of Nebraska v. Biden, the Eighth Circuit US Court of Appeals issued a temporary order prohibiting the Department of Education from discharging any student debt under the cancellation program. On November 10, 2022, US District Judge Mark T. Pittman in Texas struck down the program.   According to the US Department of Education, federal student loan payments are currently set to resume after December 31, 2022.",

    "question": "Will Wales score a goal against England on Tuesday?",
    "context": "Football, now the world's game, was probably well established in Europe long before the first unambiguous written reference, a 1314 decree in Norman French by the Mayor of London, combatting \"*graunt noise ... en la Cite, par ascunes rageries de grosses **pelotes de pee** ferir en prees du poeple, dount plusours maux par cas purrount avenir, qe Dieu defend*.\" One of the earliest probable references comes in the *Historia Brittonum* of the Welsh monk Nennius in the 9th century, contemporary with the Viking Era and the Abbasid invention of algebra, to boys playing at football in \"in the field of \u00c6lecti in the district of Glevesing\", probably modern Gloucestershire.  Modern Welsh football and the Welsh national squad date to 1876, when the Welsh Football Association formed to answer a public challenge issued by Scotland's national team. In the 146 years since, the Welsh national team has struggled to compensate for Wales' tiny population and limited talent base by mobilizing Welsh fanaticism for the game. Their high point was the glorious World Cup tournament of 1958, where the Welsh squad dispatched Mexico, Sweden, and Hungary to ascend to a quarter-final match against Brazil, who defeated them 1\u20130 with the help of a freakishly talented 17-year-old unknown named Pel\u00e9. Wales would be absent from World Cup competition for the next sixty-four years.  This drought, the longest in World Cup history, ended on June 5th, 2022, when Wales defeated Ukraine to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup tournament in Qatar. The accomplishment was called \"once-in-a-lifetime\" and \"a glorious, hysterical occasion.\" Videos of *Yma o Hyd,* the Welsh nationalist protest song come football anthem, and of Welsh actor Michael Sheen's eve-of-battle speech by the same name attained online view counts exceeding the country's entire population size of some three million.  But if anything could tamp this mania, it was Wales' 0\u20132 loss early Friday morning against Iran. To survive in the tournament, the Welsh squad now will now need not only a confluence of unlikely upsets in the other teams' matches, but to itself outright defeat the English squad, their greatest historical rival, in the game upcoming on Tuesday, November 29th. Such a result was deemed by the bookies and the base rates alike as some 80\u201390% unlikely. The viral videos became those of dejected Wales supporters cursing out TV reporters who asked for comment.  Wrote Welsh national superfan Paul Abbandonato,  > Wales somehow have to summon up ... the greatest win in [our] 146-year history if the dream we've so cherished for six decades isn't to just fizzle out almost before we've had a chance to really enjoy it properly.   In admiration for Wales' pluckiness and sympathy for the Welsh plight, we ask not whether they will escape elimination altogether, or even just be victorious on Tuesday, but simply whether they will earn one further moment of glory in this 2022 run.",

    "question": "Will WHO declare the spread of monkeypox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern before 2023?",
    "context": "Dozens of reported cases of monkeypox have been reported outside of areas in sub-Saharan Africa (namely, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo) in which it is endemic. As of 12PM EST on 19 May, there are 75 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases across the UK, Portugal, Spain, Canada, Sweden, Italy, and the US according to a spreadsheet maintained by Global.health. According to a 19 May report by the the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, many of these cases are likely the result of community transmission since many do not appear to be linked to travel: > Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities, is considered to be high. The likelihood of transmission between individuals without close contact is considered to be low.  Monkeypox is closely related to but distinct from smallpox. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980. The first case of monkeypox was diagnosed in 1970 and in recent years the frequency and geographic distribution has increased in Central Africa and West Africa.  A recent systematic review finds that monkeypox has a less severe clinical presentation and is less transmissible than smallpox, but also that it has been evolving in recent decades to become of \"global relevance.\" The same article also reports a pooled case fatality rate estimate of 8.7%, with a point estimate of 10.6% for the Central African clade and 3.6% for the West African clade. As of 18 May, all sequenced monkeypox cases seem to be of the West African clade according to the World Health Organization (WHO).   Prior to the ongoing 2022 outbreak, the majority of reported and suspected monkeypox cases were thought to be the result of animal-to-human transmission rather than human-to-human transmission. The secondary attack rate (SAR) estimates of monkeypox pre-2022 are consistent with this \u2014 according to the aforementioned systematic review article, which reviewed 16 articles with SAR estimates: > More than half of the articles (9/16) reported an SAR of 0%, and this spanned the decades from the 1970s through 2010\u20132019. Similarly, over those same five decades, the SAR ranged from 0.3\u201310.2% in 6/16 articles . In the remaining article, a median SAR of 50% was reported in an outbreak among 16 households.  However,  monkeypox now seems to be spreading as a result of close contact between humans, perhaps in particular during sexual activities.  ---------------  Under the 2005 International Health Regulations, WHO has the power30401-1/fulltext) to decide when to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). A PHEIC is an \u201cextraordinary event that constitutes a public health risk to other countries through international spread of disease and potentially requires a coordinated international response.\u201d.   Since 2009, WHO has made six PHEIC declarations, the most recent of which was the 30 January 2020-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) PHEIC declaration of COVID-19.",

While being a Schedule I substance in the U.S., and in general a legally controlled substance around the world, it's argued the classification is based on outdated science and that the drug is over-criminalized.MDMA chiefly acts as a releasing agent for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine; here's how it works. It's taken recreationally to induce euphoria, sociability, relaxation, heightened sensation and sexuality, but also brings on short-term effects like dehydration and nausea, and potential long-term effects like paranoia and addiction. However, evidence for the true extent of harm from MDMA isn't rock-solid and it appears that side-effects can be mitigated through moderate usage and dosing. There is a body of evidence for the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychiatric treatment, and many advocate that more research to evaluate MDMA's usefulness in this regard.Non-profit MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, is the only organization with funding in MDMA clinical trials to assist in the treatment of PTSD and social anxiety in autistic adults. MAPS is pushing for FDA approval of a medically available MDMA, and they are poised to enter phase 3 clinical trials in 2017. This is the last stage of research which will address the safety and effectiveness of the drug, and they are looking at trials in 200-400 people over the next 4-5 years. Their findings, if successful, are expected for submission to the FDA for approval in 2021. However, the organization says it needs about $20 million to complete the trials. At that point, the results can go to the FDA to assess MDMA as a legal medical drug. Will this happen?This question will resolve positively if by Jan 1st, 2021, the MDMA stage 3 trial is complete, with the results and an official application submitted to the FDA toward medical approval.",

He then joined Le Figaro, where he worked until 2021.[d] Zemmour appeared as a television personality on shows such as On n'est pas couch\u00e9 on France 2 (2006\u20132011) and \u00c7a se dispute on I-T\u00e9l\u00e9 (2003\u20132014).

    "context": "Chemical rockets, while great for many purposes, will never get us far outside of the solar system. With the nearest stars parsecs away, reaching them in a human lifetime requires speeds of at least 10% the speed of light. As can be seen from the rocket equation, chemical rockets with exhaust speeds of a few km/s would require exponentially large mass to attain relativistic speeds of ~100,000 km/s. It's hopeless.Unless relativistic exhaust speeds can be obtained (difficult!), leaving the solar system will require external acceleration. A variety of schemes along these lines have been proposed over the years.For example, the \"starwisp\" is a small nanowire mesh \"sail\" driven by the radiation pressure of reflected microwaves; the microwaves would be produced by a phased array of terrestrial or orbital dishes.Recently, a detailed study of laser-driven sails was posted proposing use of newly-developed ultra-high-reflectivity materials, and (now technically feasible) phased arrays of optical/IR lasers. High reflectivity allows acceleration without incineration; phased arrays allow a highly collimated beam without a laser of enormous diameter.While technically plausible, such systems would require large-scale investment in both R&D and deployment on the scale of at least a major NASA mission or large-scale particle physics project.The possibility of this occurring just received a major boost with the announcement that entrepreneur and Philanthropist Yuri Milner has committed $100 Million to a \"research and engineering program [that] will seek proof of concept for using light beam to propel gram-scale \u2018nanocraft\u2019 to 20% light speed.\"In subsequent questions we will look at the probability of developing some of the necessary technologies to make a project like this a reality. Here gauge the overall prediction of success, as quantified by further investment joining Milner's, either before or after some of the results of the research it funds.By April of 2021, will additional private or governmental sources provide a total commitment of funding to light-beam propulsion at least matching Milner's $100M?Private funding commitment would come in the form of a publicly-announced commitment like Milner's April 12 commitment; public commitment should come in the form of one or more allocated grants to institutions, or approved budget line-items at NASA or other government agencies.",

    "context": "When a massive solar storm hit the earth in 1859, it produced auroras bright enough to wake Colorado miners and threw sparks off of telegraph wires. Were such a storm to strike today, however, the consequences to our technology-dependent society would be catastrophic. Such storms are the subject of several other questions, particularly this question regarding the frequency of such storms and this one regarding the construction of a satellite warning system.Two Harvard University professors, Manasvi Lingam and Abraham Loeb, recently estimate the losses at $10 trillion, with a years-long recovery. In contrast to that cost, which is approximately 50 times the cost of NASA's initial efforts to send humans to the moon. Given estimates upward of 1%/year of such a flare, this sort of prospective loss arguably calls for significant spending at risk mitigation.Beyond warnings or damage minimization, the above paper proposes a somewhat more radical astronomical protection plan. A loop of copper wire with a diameter similar to the Earth's, they say, powered by one terawatt, could create a sufficient magnetic field so as to deflect the energy of a solar storm enough to protect the planet's technology. Placed at the Lagrange point L1, the loop would cost about $100 billion to construct, Lingam and Loeb estimate. (As a fun side-beneit, they investigate how we might look for signs of such shields built by other civilizations out there.)Will anyone take this idea seriously? We'll ask the following:By 2021, will a chunk of more than $100,000 USD be spent in pursuit of this idea?This question will resolve positively given a credible report that a grant, contract, budget line, or some similar allocation of funding equalling $100K or more has been made toward further study of, or designs for, an in-orbit Earth protecting magnetic deflection system. Effective cost of researcher or faculty time does not count, and the description of the allocation must somewhere directly reference Lingam and Loeb.",

    "context": "The gray wolf (canis lupus) is a species of canine and apex predator that is native to Eurasia and North America. Prior to the 20th century, the wolf could be found across most of the United States_&_MSW3_(2005).png). Over the past century, wolf populations drastically declined in the contiguous United States due to extermination campaigns and big prey reduction. However, a large population of wolves remained in Canada.   In 1973, the gray wolf was added to the list of species protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This protection rendered wolf hunting illegal and mandated that recovery plans be made for the species. Over the next half century, wolf populations in the contiguous United States recovered thanks to natural migration and intentional reintroductions by wildlife agencies.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature reclassified the gray wolf from being \"Vulnerable\" in 1994 to \"Least Concern\" in 2004, and in 2020 the gray wolf was delisted from the ESA (the Mexican wolf remains listed). Management of wolf populations was returned to the state agencies, and some states swiftly reestablished hunting programs, which have resulted in the reduction of local wolf populations. Petitions to relist the wolf as threatened or endangered under the ESA recently triggered the USFWS to conduct a year-long status review, which will determine if the species once again requires federal protection.",

This question is intended to be one in a series asking whether a recession will begin by the midpoint of each year, beginning July 1, 2019 through July 1, 2022. A series of binary questions is used so that Metaculus users can make separate predictions for each period rather than a single prediction over a time range.This question resolves positively if the U.S. enters a recession before July 1, 2021.Official recession determinations are made by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). However, the NBER recession determinations can be delayed by more than a year after the start of a recession; see FAQ.Accordingly, the question will be resolved positively or negatively if there is clear agreement that a recession did or did not begin during the relevant time period as reported in the economic/financial press (i.e., Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Financial Times, Forbes, the Economist, etc.). In the absence of clear agreement, resolution will be based on an official determination by the NBER. In the absence of clear agreement and, if the NBER no longer makes recession determinations, the question will resolve as ambiguous.

    "context": "The Republic of Belarus is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire.In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.The parliament of the Republic proclaimed the sovereignty of Belarus on 27 July 1990, and during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus declared independence on 25 August 1991. Alexander Lukashenko has served as the country's first president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled \"Europe's last dictatorship\" by some Western journalists on account of Lukashenko's self-described authoritarian style of government.Elections under Lukashenko's rule have been widely criticized as unfair; and according to many countries and organizations, political opposition has been violently suppressed. Belarus is also the last country in Europe using the death penalty. Belarus's Democracy Index rating is the lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as \"not free\" by Freedom House, and as \"repressed\" in the Index of Economic Freedom.In recent years, particularly since Russia made military incursions into Ukraine in 2014 and annexed Crimea, a number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) of observers have raised the possibility that Russia may in the near future invade or annex Belarus.This question asks: Before 1 January 2022, will Russia invade or annex all or part of Belarus?This question resolves positively if, before that date, representatives of the Government of the Russian Federation announce or acknowledge that Russia has invaded Belarus or annexed all or part of Belarus, or if any two Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council announce or acknowledge that the Russian Federation has invaded or annexed all or part of Belarus.",

The NEV mandate specified credit targets for 2019 (10%) and 2020 (12%), but has recently expanded targets to 2021-23 as well.  The International Energy Association (IEA) states that: > \u201cEach NEV is assigned a specific number of credits depending on metrics including electric range, energy efficiency, and rated power of fuel cell systems. Higher performance vehicles get more credits, capped at six credits per vehicle. These NEV credit targets thus may result in NEV market share falling into a range of values based on fleet mix. Assuming that all manufacturers produce vehicles with a per-vehicle NEV credit of three in 2020, for example, the market share of NEVs in China based on the number of vehicles sold would be around 4% in 2020 while still meeting the 12% target based on NEV credits.\u201d  China expects an NEV credit target of 14% in 2021 and a 2% increase for each following year until 2023, with an ending credit of 18%.   Vehicle producers need to hit the number of credits needed each year, either by producing or importing a set number of new energy passenger vehicles. There is also a market for these credits which can be sold and traded between companies, as well as the option to use surplus credits to offset CAFC (Corporate Average Fuel Consumption) credit deficits.   As credits grow, the number of electric vehicles in China\u2019s fleet should increase and consumer adoption along with it, thereby greatly reducing the amount of carbon emissions from transportation and setting China on its path to become carbon neutral by 2060.",

The resolution of this question is meant to support or undermine his preferred theory. Read the essay to learn more about how this question applies to the 'Government Debt Theory' of inflation.\n\n\nThe CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated.One approach for extracting the trend in inflation from short-term fluctuations in the CPI is to weight the food and energy components at zero on the grounds that volatility in these components can be misleading. The result is the \"core CPI,\" which this forecast question uses, and which is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (series CUUR0000SA0L1E)Commercial paper is a type of security issued by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations.

The prospect of building interstellar probes places a suddenly renewed emphasis on discovering the planetary companions to the closest stars. Exhibits A, B, and C in this effort are the members of the Alpha-Proxima Centauri triple system.The Alpha Centauri A-B binary, which lies a mere 4.37 light years distant, harbors two sun-like stars of 1.1 and 0.9 solar masses on a moderately eccentric (e=0.52) 79-year orbit. The red dwarf Proxima Centauri is likely bound to the A-B pair on a roughly million year orbit, and will be the subject of future questions in this series.Orbital integrations show that potentially habitable planets can exist in stable orbits around either Alpha Cen A or Alpha Cen B. Various methods have been proposed to detect such planets, with the Doppler Velocity technique providing the most likely route to success. Indeed, in 2012, tentative (but now largely discredited) evidence of a very short period Earth-mass planet orbiting Alpha Cen B was published in Nature.By January 1, 2020, will there be an announcement in the peer-reviewed astronomical literature of the detection of a planet with period P > 200d orbiting either (but not both) Alpha Cen A or Alpha Cen B?",

Russia's current president, Vladimir Putin, holds that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a political disaster.In 2014, Russian military invaded and annexed the Crimean peninsula, a move condemned internationally and still unrecognized by all but a handful of nations. The aftermath of the annexation has seen armed conflict in Ukraine's eastern regions, in which Russian-speaking separatists (allegedly supported by an unknown number of Russian military) fought with government forces in 2014 and 2015.More recently, Russian military activities in Kaliningrad, a non-contiguous Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania, has neighboring countries on edge. The Baltic nations of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia are members of NATO, but are also former Soviet republics, and the military buildup in Kaliningrad has raised concerns that an invasion of the Baltics, as an effort to reclaim Soviet territory, may be upcoming. In response to the threat, nearby Sweden reinstated mandatory military service.In June 2016, the Secretary General of NATO warned of Russian military buildups \"in Arctic, the Baltic, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean,\" adding \"We must respond to that.\"Will Russia pursue expansion by military means by 2020?This question will resolve as positive if Russia claims that territory of a sovereign nation is now under its authority following military activity in the area conclusively tied to Russian forces, as reported by multiple credible, verified independent sources, on or before January 1, 2020.",

Amid worries that the new variant may be more transmissible, PM Boris Johnson announced new lockdowns in London and England's southeast, including a ban on Christmas gatherings. The new variant is said to account for 60% of the infections in London.  The spread of a new variant has prompted concerns that a mutation in SARS-CoV-2 could lead to the currently approved vaccines and treatments becoming less effective. The British Medical Journal has the following to say about this possibility:  > The new variant has mutations to the spike protein that the three leading vaccines are targeting. However, vaccines produce antibodies against many regions in the spike protein, so it\u2019s unlikely that a single change would make the vaccine less effective. >  > Over time, as more mutations occur, the vaccine may need to be altered. This happens with seasonal flu, which mutates every year, and the vaccine is adjusted accordingly. The SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn\u2019t mutate as quickly as the flu virus, and the vaccines that have so far proved effective in trials are types that can easily be tweaked if necessary. >  > Peacock said, \u201cWith this variant there is no evidence that it will evade the vaccination or a human immune response. But if there is an instance of vaccine failure or reinfection then that case should be treated as high priority for genetic sequencing.\u201d  If there is a mutation and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be updated, it is possible the United States CDC will start recommending revaccination with an updated vaccine.

According to the indictment, the charges stem from allegations that Holmes and Balwani engaged in a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both schemes involved efforts to promote Theranos, a company founded by Holmes and based in Palo Alto, California.  Theranos was a private health care and life sciences company with the stated mission to revolutionize medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for drawing blood, testing blood, and interpreting the resulting patient data.  Holmes and Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors and patients to use Theranos\u2019s blood testing laboratory services, even though, according to the government, the defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests.  It is further alleged that the tests performed on Theranos technology were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results. Holmes denies the charges and is presumed to be innocent.   Theranos raised more than $700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. By 2015, Forbes had named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America.  A turning point came later in 2015 when medical research professors John Ioannidis and Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018.  Holmes is currently awaiting trial. The jury selection process will begin soon, subject to further legal wrangling, with the trial expected to commence on August 31. However, the trial has been delayed a number of times, and it may be delayed again. According to a jury questionnaire proposed by Holmes' lawyers, the trial is expected to last 13 weeks, or possibly longer.",

While the 'power of veto' is not mentioned by name in the UN Charter, Article 27 grants each of the five permanent member states the ability to veto any 'substantive' resolution.  Since the first veto in 1946, the use of the veto power has reflected shifting political balances. Early in the history of the UN, the majority of vetoes were cast by the Soviet Union. From 1970 to 1991, the US cast 56% of the vetoes. In recent years, this balance has once again shifted: China has not cast a lone veto vote since 1999, and has frequently joined Russia in vetoes since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Neither France nor the UK has used their veto power since 1989.",

In Rostker v. Goldberg (1981), the Supreme Court had upheld the male-only draft as Constitutional on the grounds that women were barred from serving in combat roles at the time. But in 2015 combat roles were opened to female soldiers.NCFM sued the government, arguing that the basis for the decision in Rostker v. Goldberg had been invalidated. NCFM argued the previous case should be overturned and the male-only draft ruled unconstitutional. The case reached the Fifth Circuit, which in an opinion stated:NCFM filed an appeal to the Supreme Court on January 8th, 2021 requesting their case be heard.Will the Supreme Court grant a writ of certiorari to a case challenging the Military Selective Service Act as unconstitutional on the grounds of sex-discrimination by the end of 2021?The question will resolve positively if the Supreme Court grants certiorari to hear NCFM v. Selective Service System or any other case challenging the constitutionality of the male-only draft between the date the question opens and the resolution.

The city is being developed in a previously unoccupied 58 acre area that has been carved out of Honduras under a legal arrangement called ZEDE (Spanish acronym for Zone for Employment and Economic Development).

    "question": "In 2021 will the European Commission suspend all EU mink farming, including breeding, and all in-country and cross-border transportation of live mink and their raw pelts?",
    "context": "In early November 2020, a variant strain was identified in Denmark as having an association with mink farming. This led to the immediate cull of all Danish farmed mink (more than 17 million) including breeding stock,  which could lead to a \"de facto permanent closure and liquidation of the fur industry\".  As of December 2020, the virus has been detected in mink on 289 mink farms in Denmark, 70 in the Netherlands, 10 in Sweden, 10 in Greece, 1 in Spain, 1 in Italy, 1 in France, 1 in Lithuania and a still undefined number in Poland.  France has suspended new mink farms and will phase out existing mink farms no later than 2025.  The Netherlands moved forward its plan to to shut down mink fur farms by 2024, and now is expected to end all mink farming by March 2021.  The Irish government ordered the cull of its mink as a precautionary measure.In 2019, the previous Irish government pledged to deliver a bill banning fur farming.   Hungary also announced a ban on mink and other species farming as a precautionary measure (no mink farming occurs in Hungary presently).  In Germany, fur farming will be phased out in 2022 due to stricter welfare requirements.  In January 2021, the Swedish government announced that the mink industry in Sweden will be shut down during 2021 as a consequence of the corona pandemic  Fur farming has already been prohibited and/or is presently being phased out in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia. Legislative proposals to ban fur farming are currently also under consideration, or have been announced, in Poland, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Estonia.  In November 2020, a Danish Member of the European Parliament raised the issue of an EU-wide mink cull and the German Minister of Agriculture and former president of the Council, Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, questioned whether mink farming still has a future. The Austrian Federal Minister of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection Rudolf Anschober called for an initiative for an EU-wide end of the fur industry for public health and animal welfare reasons.",

According to Section 13 of the Constitution, elections for these retiring Senators must be held \"within one year before the places are to become vacant.\"  While not constitutionally required, the half-Senate elections are customarily held at the same time as House of Representatives elections.

If ratified, it would represent the largest trade deal struck by both the EU and Mercosur in terms of citizens involved.The trade deal is part of a wider Association Agreement between the two blocs.  Once the texts are final and legally revised they will need to be translated in all EU and Mercosur official languages.The texts will then be presented by the European Commission to the Council of Ministers of the European Union for approval. In the Council unanimity is required. If approved the Council will sign the agreement and send it over to the Mercosur countries and to the European Parliament. An EU association agreement must also be approved by the national parliaments of all EU member states. Ratification of the agreement by the national parliaments of the Mercosur countries is also required.  The deal has been denounced by European beef farmers, environmental activists, animal welfare advocates, and indigenous rights campaigners. Protests against the deal have taken place. Governments and parliaments of the EU member states have also criticised the agreement.

However, the Coalition's own modelling expects 25-50% EV share of new car sales by 2030.  The Coalition has since moderated its language around EVs, but car companies and their representatives have described Australia's EV policies as akin to \"a third world country\" (Volkswagen), a \"uniquely hostile market\" (Electric Vehicle Council) and lacking \"consistent and cohesive national targets and supporting policies\" (Nissan) (source)  We have one prediction already: last year BloombergNEF predicted EVs as 18% of new car sales in 2030.",

It had been expected that NASA would issue two awards, due to its previous statements that competition and redundancy were \"extremely important principles\" for the program, and so only having one was widely seen as surprising.  In its source selection statement [pdf], NASA stressed that the selection of a single provider was due entirely to the fact that the HLS program was underfunded, to the point where they could only award the cheapest bid from SpaceX after negotiating with them to change the funding schedule. Later information releases revealed that SpaceX had bid $2.9B, Blue Origin $5.9B, and Dynetics approximately $8.5B.   There have been several developments since then which have raised the possibility of NASA revisiting this contract and awarding two providers as it had originally planned:  * Blue Origin and Dynetics quickly filed protests on what they claim to be an unfair award selection, and NASA issued a stop-work order to SpaceX until the Government Accountability Office reviewed the protests. The GAO denied these protest on July 30, saying that NASA acted legally in awarding only a single company.  * The version of S. 1260 *The U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Act* which the Senate passed on June 8 includes in it language which directs NASA to select a second HLS provider, while protecting SpaceX's current award. It would have to do this within 60 days from the current list of bids, which means either Blue Origin or Dynetics would be selected. However, this directive is an *authorization*, not an *appropriation*, meaning that it does not provide funding for this mandate. Additionally, it appears that there may be some resistance to this in the House, and the bill's ultimate future is unknown.  * NASA Administrator Bill Nelson is pushing to fund HLS with a total of $10B through the \"infrastructure bill\" which Congress is currently debating.  * On July 26, Jeff Bezos offered to waive the first $2 billion in costs if NASA chose Blue Origin as a second HLS lander system.",

Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have vowed that not a single one of them will vote to raise the limit.  As of September 20th, Business Insider reports that Mitch McConnell says the GOP will vote for the US to default on its debt:  >\"We will not support legislation that raises the debt limit,\" McConnell said after Pelosi and Schumer's announcement. \"Democrats do not need our help.\"  It is currently unclear when exactly the US would become unable to meet its obligations; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said only that the Treasury will run out of cash \u201csometime in October.\u201d",

This is leading to R&D with the ultimate aim of commercializing therapies directed at slowing aging itself.One of the more popular areas of research involves senolytics \u2014 a class of drugs that target and destroy aging (or senescent) cells. These drugs are in the early stages of development and might be approved by the FDA to be prescribed to target a specific condition or disease, and would carry the secondary impact of slowing down aging. Some, (notably, Unity Biotechnology, the >$200M startup) are betting large on the success of senolytics.According to a research report by CBINSIGHTS, around $800M was invested in longevity startups in 2018 (see specifically this chart). This was the result of several large deals (such as UNITY Biotechnology series B, Insilico Medicine series A, and a deal by AgeX Therapeutics).Even more impressive was Sumumed's 2018 fundraising campaign, which raised a total of $438M.Will total funding in longevity startups worldwide exceed $5bn in the year ending in November 2nd, 2020 (i.e. from November 2nd, 2019 to November 2nd 2020)?This question resolves positively if credible reports indicate that $5000M or more has been invested through seed stage and mid stage funding rounds, in longevity startups in the year ending in November 2nd, 2020, according to data from crunchbase or other sources of venture capital and angel investment financing information.

    "context": "Throughout his campaign, and now in the beginning of his presidency, Donald Trump has refused to make public his tax returns. Every elected president since Richard Nixon has done so, and although Trump has claimed that he is unable to release his returns because of an ongoing audit, the IRS and other experts have repeatedly said that there is no restriction preventing their release.The tax returns would address several key points of concern:His actual net worth, which has been reported as $3.7B and self-reported as upwards of $10B. Trump's success and wealth are cornerstones of his brand, although his true net worth is currently unknown.The amount of tax he pays. Documents released in 2016 showed that he paid no taxes in 1995 and may not have for the following 18 years.The extent of his foreign holdings, which could become conflicts of interest as he interacts with governments in his official role as president. Making his tax returns public would help sort out the ways Trump could stand to gain personally from foreign policies. Much has been said and written about President Trump's possible violation of the Constitution's Emoluments clause, which prohibits public officials from receiving gifts or payments from other governments. One of the ways to resolve such concerns is through Trump's tax returns.In particular, the returns would detail Trump's holdings in Russia. The president's relationship with Russia has been under scrutiny since the campaign.Although President Trump has continued to refuse calls to release his returns, mechanisms are in place to require their release. Congress can subpoena the records from the IRS, which would then become public information. Such a subpoena could be part of an investigation into any of the above issues, particularly an investigation into dealings with Russia.The stakes are high, and the information in the tax returns could be politically devastating to the president, if it indeed contains proof of unethical behavior or evidence contradicting the president's assertions of no wrongdoing in foreign dealings. One writer has suggested that a subpoena of Trump's tax information would trigger the president's resignation, as he would rather vacate the office than see his tax returns come to light.Will Donald Trump's tax returns become public information during his current term as president?This question will resolve as positive if at least one year's worth of Donald Trump's tax returns from within the previous ten years becomes public information by any means (and such information is confirmed as genuine by credible sources) on or before Jan. 20, 2021.",

Of particular concern to public health authorities in Virginia are SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating that are thought to be able to partially evade immunity induced by prior infection and/or vaccination.

For our purposes, variants of concern and variants of high consequence are of particular interest:   > - **Variant of concern (VOC)**: \u201cvariant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\u201d As of the most recent CDC update on 27 April, there are five VOCs: B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429. - **Variant of high consequence (VOHC)**: \u201cvariant of high consequence has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.\u201d As of the most recent CDC update on 27 April, there are no VOHCs.   Of the five variants categorized under these categories (all five are VOCs), as of 27 April 2021 there are four that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera\" (indicating they are able to partially evade immunity induced by infection and vaccination): P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429.

Similarly, Hans Eysenck has in recent years been facing numerous retraction requests concerning his work with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek on personality and health. Finally, very recently, a paper by Phil Rushton was retracted, *Do pigmentation and the melanocortin system modulate aggression and sexuality in humans as they do in other animals?*:  >This article (Rushton, J. P., & Templer, D. I. (2012). Do pigmentation and the melanocortin system modulate aggression and sexuality in humans as they do in other animals? Personality and Individual Differences, 53(1), 4\u20138. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2012.02.015) has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and the majority of Senior Associate Editors of Personality and Individual Differences and in consultation with the Executive Officers and Board of Directors of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences (ISSID).  The reasons given for the retraction were as follows: > (1) Rushton & Templer drew on a review paper in an Ecology journal (Ducrest et al., 2008) which argues that genetic variants which influence skin colour may also influence aggression, sexual activity and resistance to stress \u2013 mainly based on birds and fish. The correspondent and geneticist each comment that the genes responsible for skin pigmentation in humans are completely different to the genes in these animals. It therefore makes no sense to extrapolate from these animal studies to humans. Ducrest et al. made this crystal clear: \u201chuman populations are therefore not expected to consistently exhibit the associations between melanin-based coloration and the physiological and behavioural traits reported in our study\u201d. As the geneticist observes, \u201cthe point about genetic variants for skin pigmentation being different in humans makes all the other vertebrate work cited inconsequential\u201d.  >(2) Rushton & Templer claimed that there are black/white (human) differences in levels of psychopathy. As required of a review paper, the authors should have been aware of a literature showing that black-white differences in the best-available measure of psychopathy are negligible (Skeem et al., 2004). They instead relied on an analysis by Lynn (2002) which has been extensively criticized (Skeem, Edens, Sanford, & Colwell, 2003; Zuckerman, 2003).  >(3) Rushton & Templer ignored obvious social and educational explanations for higher levels of violence, HIV infection etc. in African and Caribbean countries whilst favouring a genetic theory.  >(4) Rushton & Templer made several errors when interpreting the results summarised by Ducrest et al. Although relatively minor, these errors consistently favoured their genetic thesis.  A detailed writeup of the problems with the paper is available here.  Both authors of this paper are deceased (as is Hans Eysenck), so could not address the concerns raised about their work. This question asks:",

Revelations at the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Berejiklian had been in a long-term relationship with Daryl Maguire, a former member of state parliament and the subject of the commission's inquiry, have caused controversy.   The ICAC revelations were followed by other missteps by the Premier, but whether they will jeopardise her position remains to be seen.   The NSW parliamentary system gives members of the party in government the ability to vote on their leader, and so change the Premier outside of an election. Leaders may also resign and can be removed by the Governor.  Over the last 20 years, NSW has had seven premiers. Of these, one was defeated by a leadership spill, four resigned, and one lost an election. Notably, Barry O'Farrell resigned his premiership in 2014 after it was found he had misled the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

Globalization, including internet connectivity, international trade, and international travel elevate the importance of these top languages, particularly the six languages with the most speakers: Chinese, Spanish, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Portuguese.Globalization can endanger languages as well because rising generations learn regional and national languages instead of local or traditional dialects. Estimates of endangered languages range from around 20% to around 50% of all documented languages. Hundreds of languages have already been lost, and the current language death rate is between four and six languages per year. Ethnologue, an annual report on language status, reports that 360 languages reported as \"living\" in their first 1951 report have since been classified as \"extinct.\" 423 languages are considered \"nearly extinct,\" meaning that the only user are aging speakers who have little opportunity to use the language in everyday life.But technology can also help preserve and revitalize languages, with digital documentation and language resources aiming to save some of the most critically endangered languages.

In order to do this, scientists and engineers have to account for factors, such as money and weight.To make a decent mission and to gather as much data as possible, a probe that NASA could send has to carry with it many scientific instruments. The more instruments there are, the heavier the probe is (and more expensive). The heavier the probe is, the more powerful the rocket to send it has to be. The more powerful the rocket is, the more expensive the mission is. Money and weight are the two main factors to make a mission to space.These days, NASA's budget is more and more reduced. It was 0.47% of the federal budget in 2017 whereas it could reach 4.41% during the Apollo era. Only a few missions can be made, and most of them concern the study of Earth, stars, or the internal solar system. Even though some missions plan to study Jupiter, its moons, and sometimes Saturn, not a single mission, not even as a project, is planified to study space beyond the orbit of Saturn at the moment. The last and only mission that studied Uranus and Neptune was Voyager 2 and New Horizons studied Pluto for a few hours after a 9 years journey through space.But earlier this year, the Falcon Heavy was launched for the first time. SpaceX's new heavy launcher, and current most powerful rocket is capable of launching 63,800 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 3,500 kg to Pluto, for a cost of 150M $, whereas the Delta IV heavy, the previous most powerful rocket, could only launch 28 790 kg to LEO for a cost of 400M $.

    "context": "In early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of Planet Nine, a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.Batygin and Brown's paper, has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.Follow-up papers by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an explanation for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it can account for curious orbital commensurabilities among the most distant members of the Kuipier Belt, and it has been hypothesized that it can explain the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.The planet, however, remains to be found.If it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the use of data from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published an update to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.It thus seems timely to release this fifth update to our original, now long-closed, Planet Nine question. Specifically:Will the detection (by direct optical observation) of a new Solar System planet occur by July 1, 2021?For this question to resolve as \"Yes\", the new Solar System planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, and an orbital period greater than 5,000 years.",

    "question": "Will functional respirocytes be used successfully in any mammal before 2035?",
    "context": "Respirocytes are hypothetical artificial red blood cells that are intended to emulate the function of their organic counterparts, so as to supplement or replace the function of much of the human body's normal respiratory system. Respirocytes were proposed by Robert A. Freitas Jr in his 1998 paper \"A Mechanical Artificial Red Blood Cell: Exploratory Design in Medical Nanotechnology\".The respirocyte is a bloodborne 1-micron-diameter spherical nanomedical device designed by Robert A. Freitas Jr. The device acts as an artificial mechanical red blood cell. It is designed as a diamondoid 1000-atmosphere pressure vessel with active pumping powered by endogenous serum glucose, and can deliver 236 times more oxygen to the tissues per unit volume than natural red cells while simultaneously managing carbonic acidity.An individual respirocyte consists of 18 billion precisely arranged structural atoms plus 9 billion temporarily resident molecules when fully loaded. An onboard nanocomputer and numerous chemical and pressure sensors allow the device to exhibit behaviors of modest complexity, remotely reprogrammable by the physician via externally applied acoustic signals.The design calls for twelve pumping stations to be spaced evenly along an equatorial circle. Each station has its own independent glucose-metabolizing powerplant, glucose tank, environmental glucose sensors, and glucose sorting rotors. Each station alone can generate sufficient energy to power the entire respirocyte, and has an array of 3-stage molecular sorting rotor assemblies for pumping O2, CO2, and H2O from the ambient medium into an interior chamber, and vice versa. The number of rotor sorters in each array is determined both by performance requirements and by the anticipated concentration of each target molecule in the bloodstream.The equatorial pumping station network occupies ~50% of respirocyte surface. On the remaining surface, a universal \"bar code\" consisting of concentric circular patterns of shallow rounded ridges is embossed on each side, centered on the \"north pole\" and \"south pole\" of the device. This coding permits easy product identification by an attending physician with a small blood sample and access to an electron microscope, and may also allow rapid reading by other more sophisticated medical nanorobots which might be deployed in the future.The promise of artificial mechanical red cells is that it gives physicians the ability to precisely control saturation curve profiles independently for oxygen and carbon dioxide, either to maximize gas transport efficiency or to meet specialized demand functions imposed by emergency situations, unusual activities, or specific medical treatments.Respirocytes are an example of molecular nanotechnology, a field of technology still in the very earliest, purely hypothetical phase of development. Current technology is not sufficient to build a respirocyte due to considerations of power, atomic-scale manipulation, immune reaction or toxicity, computation and communication. Creation of this kind of device would require multiple technological breakthroughs. For further information on respirocytes, see e.g. this essay by Freitas.This question asks: Before 1 January 2035, will 'artificial red blood cells' with broadly the functionality described by Freitas be used successfully in any mammal?Resolves positively upon the publication of an article in a respectable scientific journal indicating that such devices have been successfully used in a living mammal to meaningfully augment and or replace (partially or totally) the existing supply of red blood cells. A meaningful augmentation is an augmentation resulting in a non-trivial increase in overall performance of the existing red cell population. These respirocytes will need to be perform at least some gas transport function, and be principally the product of nanotechnology techniques, including (but not limited to) those outlined by Freitas' article. This therefore excludes transfusions of modified red blood cells from existing organisms. Finally, the mammal needs to survive at least 7 days after the introduction of the respirocytes.",

Texas (known as Texas v. U.S. in the lower courts). Oral argument is scheduled for Tuesday, November 10, 2020. This ongoing litigation challenges the ACA\u2019s minimum essential coverage provision (known as the individual mandate) and raises questions about the entire law\u2019s survival. The individual mandate provides that most people must maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage; those who do not do so must pay a financial penalty (known as the shared responsibility payment) to the IRS. The individual mandate was upheld as a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 taxing power by a five member majority of the Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius in 2012.  > In the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), Congress set the shared responsibility payment at zero dollars as of January 1, 2019, leading to the current litigation. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that the individual mandate is no longer constitutional because the associated financial penalty no longer \u201cproduces at least some revenue\u201d for the federal government. But, instead of deciding whether the rest of the ACA must be struck down, the 5th Circuit sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis.

    "question": "Will President Trump fire (or request and accept the resignation of) Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve?",
    "context": "The Federal Reserve System (also known as the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States of America. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.The Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the head of the Federal Reserve. The chair is chosen by the President of the United States from among the members of the Board of Governors; and serves for four-year-terms after appointment. A chair may be appointed for several consecutive terms. William Martin was the longest serving chair, holding the position from 1951 to 1970.As stipulated by the Banking Act of 1935, the President of the United States appoints the seven members of the Board of Governors; they must then be confirmed by the Senate and serve fourteen year terms.The nominees for chair and vice-chair may be chosen by the President from among the sitting Governors for four-year terms; these appointments are also subject to Senate confirmation. The Senate Committee responsible for vetting a Federal Reserve Chair nominee is the Senate Committee on Banking.Jerome Hayden \"Jay\" Powell is the 16th and current Chair of the Federal Reserve, serving in that office since February 2018. He was nominated to the Fed Chair position by President Donald Trump, and confirmed by the United States Senate.Since Powell took the position of Fed Chair, the performance of major US equity indicies has been disappointing. President Trump has indicated that he is unhappy with the Fed's decision to raise interest rates several times this year. This has raised questions over whether Trump will try to replace Powell with a more accomodative Fed Chair.According to Bloomberg, \"any attempt by Trump to push out Powell would have potentially devastating ripple effects across financial markets, undermining investors\u2019 confidence in the central bank\u2019s ability to shepherd the economy without political interference. It would come as markets have plummeted in recent weeks, with the major stock indexes already down sharply for the year.\"Section 10.2 of the Federal Reserve Act provides that upon the expiration of the term of any appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board in office on the date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, the President shall fix the term of the successor to such member at not to exceed fourteen years, as designated by the President at the time of nomination, but in such manner as to provide for the expiration of the term of not more than one member in any two-year period, and thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President.So far, no Fed Chairman has been removed by a President.Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) outlines the President's authority to remove appointed officials. Given that there is no precedent for a President attempting to fire a Fed Chairman, it is not entirely clear whether the President has the absolute authority to do so. In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers. The latter may be removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress; the former serve at the pleasure of the President and may be removed at his discretion. The legal question on Presidential authority hinges on which of these positions the Federal Reserve Chairman is found to occupy.This question asks: Will President Trump fire Jerome Powell, or ask him to resign, with Powell acceding to that request?This question resolves positively if credible media reports in the U.S. financial press state that Jerome Powell has left the position of Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and that he was either fired or asked by Trump or the Trump Administration to resign from the office.It resolves negatively if Powell leaves of his own accord (e.g. to retire or pursue other opportunities, or in protest against Trump Administration policy or Trump himself), or if he leaves for reasons other than those outlined above (e.g. death, disability, incapacity, et cetera), or if his term of office expires and he is not appointed to a new term, does not seek a new term, or refuses to accept a new term.The question also resolves negatively if Jerome Powell is still Fed Chairman when Donald Trump ceases to be President of the United States.",

    "question": "Will the hole in the Ozone layer shrink in the next 5 years?",
    "context": "One of the prominent environmental storylines of the 1980s and 1990s was the hole in the ozone layer. After a sweeping ban on ozone-depleting chemicals in 1987, the degradation of the ozone layer appears to have slowed, and is now poised for recovery.Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms. A layer of ozone sits about 6 miles above the earth, in the stratosphere, and protects earth from harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation. Ozone reacts very easily with other chemicals, however. Chlorine and bromine can knock an oxygen atom off of an ozone molecule, leaving an oxygen atom that cannot perform the same protective function as ozone.Chloroflurocarbons, chemicals used in refrigeration, are particularly effective in destroying ozone molecules. After a seasonal hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985, however, international cooperation yielded an agreement in 1987 to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. Since then, the amount of chlorine in the atmosphere that poses a danger to ozone has peaked and is beginning to decline. The size of the ozone hole reached its largest recorded extent in 2006, at 30 million square kilometers, but hasn't surpassed that number since. A running five-year average of ozone hole size from NASA data shows values ranging from 20.7-24 million square kilometers post-2000. The size of the hole appears to have plateaued. Forecasts point to a slow, steady recovery by mid-century, but there is not yet convincing evidence that the ozone hole has actually decreased in size.Will the annual maximum Antarctic ozone hole size begin its recovery by 2020?For this question to resolve as positive, an atmospheric science report, NASA, (or data from another credible group that reproduces the same existing NASA data) must report results showing that the running five-year average of the mean September-October ozone hole size drops below 20.7 million square kilometers on or before December 31, 2020.",

Therefore, SpaceX is currently focusing on the upper stage (currently called \"Starship\" and before that \"Big Falcon Spaceship\" or \"BFS\").For those losing track of Musk's repeated renaming of the project Wikipedia provides up-to date section on BFR nomenclature.About renaming BFR to Starship, Musk's has said:All rockets capable of reaching Earth's orbit with useful payload are built with at least two stages. Sometimes more. This is due to the rocket equation. Dumping the dead weight of an empty first stage allows for more efficient use of energy. Super Heavy Starship (or BFR) is also built with two stages: the first stage is called \"Super Heavy\" and the second stage is called \"Starship\" (or BFS).An interesting aspect of the Starship is that it will be able to fly without the Super Heavy. That will allow it to return from other planets and moons to the Earth. It will also be capable of single stage to orbit launch from the Earth without any useful payload. The capability is intended to be used for testing of entering planets atmospheres from super orbital velocities like Mars/Moon transfer velocities. According to Musk there are certain heating parameters that scale to the eighth power with regard to speed.See Musk's explanation of how Starship will be tested.In January 2019 an early test version of the Starship was assembled.Regarding first orbital prototype Musk was predicting:The question asks:The question will resolve positively if we get information from SpaceX that any test version of Starship with or without a booster reached space before 1 January 2021. For purpose of this question reaching space will mean being at attitude of at least 80km. After reaching space, it could even explode without affecting how this question resolves. In case of failures before reaching space, several attempts are allowed.The question will resolve negatively if no test is attempted or Starship will not reach space as defined above.Musk himself predicts:Similar questions:",

Until 2017, he was a member of the left-wing Labor Party, and was the leader of the Parliamentary party between the 2nd of December 2003 and the 18th of January 2005, when he also resigned from Parliament. In May 2017, he joined the libertarian Liberal Democrats, only to leave in September 2018 to join the nationalist and right-wing populist party One Nation. Then, on the 23rd of March 2019, he was elected to the upper house (Legislative Council or LC) of the Australian state of New South Wales as a One Nation member.

In this question, we ask:Will Mark Latham be a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party on the 1st of January 2021?If on that date he is, as expected, still a member of the LC, then resolution will be based on the list of members on that body's website.

Although the goal is to end preventable blindness before 2020, the technology is still in testing and the greatest barrier is delivering treatments to the people who need them.Two treatment methods focus on repairing damage in the retina itself. Gene therapy targets genetic disorders in eyes by inserting a functional replacement gene into a carrier virus, which incorporates itself into retinal cells. Stem cell therapy aims to replenish damaged or degraded retinas by placing targeted populations of stem cells, which can differentiate into any cell type in the body, in a position to form new rods and cones, the cells essential to sight. Gene therapy is already in clinical use in patients, while stem cell therapy is still in the trial stage.Another route is a retinal implant. Bionic eyes work just like natural eyes, by collecting and focusing light and relaying the light signals to the brain. Only a handful of people have received an implant so far, and the images produced are little more than areas of light and dark - but the technology is improving.The World Health Organization reports that 80% of all blindness is preventable or treatable and that the only major remaining non-treatable cause of blindness is age-related macular degeneration.

Under Kim Jong-un, more than 80 tests have been undertaken.Despite a tentative cooling of tensions between North Korea and the US in 2018 and 2019, Kim Jong-Un stated in late December 2019 that North Korea would no longer adhere to a moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing, and that North Korea would soon demonstrate a 'new strategic weapon.'This question asks: Will North Korea launch, for any reason, an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2020?This question will resolve as positive when a guided missile with a range of more than 5,500 km, capable of hosting a nuclear warhead, is launched by the North Korean government. Resolution is by credible media report, with assessment provided by US or UK government or United Nations or by confirmation of any any permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council.

Her term has encompassed both the devastating bush fires of January 2020 and the COVID-19 crisis.

Maguire resigned in 2018 after it was revealed that he had sought inappropriate payments in return for favours to developers. Over the last week ICAC has found that not only did Maguire receive payments from developers in return for favours, he was also involved in a 'cash for visa's scam' targeting Chinese nationals. Ms Berejiklian has not been directly implicated in either scheme.  The NSW parliamentary system gives members of the party in government the ability to vote on their leader, and so change the Premier outside of an election. Leaders may also resign and can be removed by the Governor.  Over the last 20 years, NSW has had 7 premiers. Of these, 1 was defeated by a leadership spill, 4 resigned, and 1 lost an election.

    "context": "Nextbigfuture predicts that the efforts to recall California Governor Newsom will succeed in getting over 1.5 million signatures certified before the February 2020 and/or March 2020 deadlines. This would force a special recall vote with an up-down on the recall and votes for a possible replacement.Under California law, any elected official may be the target of a recall campaign. To trigger a recall election, proponents of the recall must gather a certain number of signatures from registered voters within a certain time period. The number of signatures statewide must equal 12% of the number of votes cast in the previous election for that office.Under most circumstances in which a recall campaign against a statewide elected official has gathered the required number of signatures, the governor is required to schedule a special election for the recall vote. If the recall campaign qualified less than 180 days prior to the next regularly scheduled election, then the recall becomes part of that regularly scheduled election. In recall of the governor, the responsibility for scheduling a special election falls on the lieutenant governor.The recall ballot has two components: * a yes or no vote for recall, and the names of replacement candidates, selected by the nomination process used in regular elections. * The recall measure itself is successful if it passes by a majority. In that case, the replacement candidate with a simple plurality of votes wins the office. If the recall measure fails, the replacement candidate votes are ignored.The Cruz recall was approved for circulation by the California Secretary of State on September 6, 2019. Supporters of that recall have until February 13, 2020, to collect 1,495,709 signatures to force a recall election.The Veltmeyer recall was approved for circulation on September 27, 2019.

Noisy quantum computers in the small and intermediate scale deliver primitive computational power. They are too primitive to reach \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2014 and if quantum supremacy is not possible, then creating quantum error-correcting codes, which is harder, is also impossible.\u201dWill quantum supremacy be achieved by 2025, rather than proving elusive for years to come if not indefinitely?The question resolves positively if quantum supremacy has been demonstrated by 2025. Precisely defining quantum supremacy is itself somewhat tricky. We will thus use a working definition that John Preskill, inventor of the term, makes public declarations to the effect that it has been definitively shown.",

    "context": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is a novel betacoronavirus that likely emerged late last year from an animal reservoir in China. There is little to no pre-existing immunity against it in the human population. The clinical picture for the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranges from very mild to fatal. The virus is highly transmissible and has spread globally.As of 20 March 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) is reporting that it is tracking the development of forty-four SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines. Two of these candidates have entered phase one and the other forty-two remain in the pre-clinical stage. One of the candidates in phase one is a RNA vaccine candidate, as are seven of the candidates in the pre-clinical stage.RNA vaccines are of particular interest because they can be developed and produced relatively quickly since, unlike other vaccine platforms, they do not require fermentation or culture and instead use faster synthetic processes. As a result, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate to enter a phase one clinical trial is a RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which was developed by Moderna Therapeutics at record speed.While promising, RNA-based vaccine platforms are a new development and the field is still nascent. No RNA vaccine has ever made it to market. And since no RNA vaccine has been approved to date, there is an urgent need to determine the likelihood of successful development of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.This question asks: Will a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate be approved for use in the United States or European Union before 2022?Resolution will be determined via the first relevant press release made by the FDA, EMA, or European Commission regarding the approval of a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In the United States, approval means that the vaccine candidate has been licensed by the FDA. In the European Union, approval means that the EMA has recommended the vaccine candidate for approval and the European Commission has granted that approval via marketing authorization. Approval under any other emergency procedures, such as expanded access, would not count.",

    "question": "Will online voting spread in the US before the next presidential election?",
    "context": "Although critical to the democratic model of government, voting in America has some problems. Turnout is often low, and the terms \"butterfly ballot\" and \"hanging chad\" still linger in our collective consciousness following the uncertainty of the 2000 presidential election.Since we are already able to do practically everything else via the internet \u2013bank, shop, communicate, etc., \u2013 online voting seems like a natural next step. Some argue that online voting would increase turnout and bring voting access to anyone with the internet, without the need to go to a polling place on Election Day.Currently, 22 states allow for some form of online voting, allowing members of the military and other citizens living overseas to return their ballots by email. Only one state - Alaska - allows any registered voter, provided they pre-register, to use an online voting portal. Four other states offer an online voting portal. In March 2016 the Utah Republican Party offered online voting to all registered voters in its presidential caucus.The major problem that hampers every proposal for online voting is security. Repeated analyses find that, given the impossibility of sufficiently protecting the millions of personal devices that would be used in an online election, the risk of malicious interference in the election is too high to recommend proceeding with online voting. The stakes are also too high, the analysts say, with no less than the balance of American political power in play.Still, multiple online voting vendors exist, each claiming to be secure. The fate of online voting may depend on who can make the most innovative advances in internet security: vendors or hackers.Will online voting for all registered voters expand by the 2020 general election?To resolve as positive, a credible news outlet must report that at least five states will allow any registered voter to submit their ballot for the 2020 general election via email or an online voting portal on or before November 3, 2020.",

    "context": "Nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare on two occasions in world history: on August 6 and 9 1945 in American attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. However, there have been more than 2,000 detonations of nuclear devices since the July 16 1945 Trinity test.The official tally of verified nuclear detonations can be found here.As of December 2018, the most recent confirmed detonation took place on September 3 2017 when North Korea claimed to have successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb that yielded 70-280kt. It is debated whether the device was actually a boosted fission weapon rather than an actual staged Teller\u2013Ulam thermonuclear weapon, but qualified experts agree that a nuclear device was successfully detonated, and condemndations were issued by (inter alia) the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and the Russian Federation.There have in the past been a number of incidents which are suspected to have been clandestine or undeclared nuclear tests, but for this question we will consider only admitted nuclear tests or detonations, or incidents that are recognized by at least three Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council to have been nuclear tests or detonations. In the event that the the only suspected nuclear tests or detonations are recognized by only two or fewer Permanent Members of the UN Security Council, this question shall resolve ambiguously.This question shall resolve positively if any nation, group or individual admits conducting a test or other detonation of a nuclear device with a yield above 1 kiloton of TNT, or if the above conditions are satisfied, anywhere on Earth between midnight UTC on 1 January 2019 and 23:59:59 UTC on 31 December 2019. Tests or detonations occuring more than 100km above Earth's mean sea level are excluded, as are zero-yield detonations in safety tests and any failures with a yield under 1kt.",

Health officials have cautioned against attending large meetings such as this out of concerns for spreading Coronavirus. Many people believe it is foolish.So how are we to define \"a spike\"? How many of those 6,200 attendees have to get Coronavirus to declare it a \"spike\"? Lets consider some simplistic statistics, Oklahoma has a population of about 3,957,000. COVID cases are spiking in Oklahoma, reporting 1,392 new cases from June 17-20. If we apply those numbers to the rally, we might expect 1,392/3,957,000 * 6,200 = 2.18 new COVID cases among the 6,200 attendees of the rally.Will Donald Trump's Tulsa Oklahoma rally on June 20 result in a spike of COVID-19 cases?To be resolved positively reports by a health authority, NY Times, Washington Post, ABC, NBC, PBS, CBS or Fox must report that more than 19 persons likely became infected with COVID by attending the Tulsa rally on June 20.This reporting must take place before August 1st, 12PM EST.",

    "context": "Nate Silver and his fivethirtyeight site has achieved significant notoriety for developing a system to carefully aggregate election polls to create well-calibrated statistical forecasts of outcome elections; his site publishes daily updates to predictions for primary and general elections in House, Senate and Presidential races.Prediction markets have offered an alternative to poll aggregation in forecasting elections. Markets such as (the now defunct) InTrade, the Iowa Electronic Markets, PredictIt, and others ask users to buy and sell shares assigned to each candidate in each race, so that the price point corresponds to the probability of victory. In this question we focus on PredictIt, which allows users to place relatively small real-money bets on candidates.Both fivethirtyeight.com and PredictIt have published probabilities for each of the 14 Super Tuesday Primaries on the Democratic side. (The races are California, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine, Vermont.)Which forecasts will prove to be more accurate?To compare, we will score each set of predictions using a Brier score averaged over all [Math Processing Error] races, computed as [Math Processing Error] where j enumerates the [Math Processing Error] possible outcomes (i.e. possible winners) in the ith race out of N, where [Math Processing Error] is the forecast probability of candidate j winning the ith race, and [Math Processing Error] is assigned 1 if candidate j wins the ith race, and 0 otherwise.For example, if PredictIt assigned 52% to Sanders and 48% to Warren in the New York Democratic Primary and if Sanders won then PredictIt would achieve a Brier Score of [Math Processing Error] A lower Brier score is better, with perfect predictions corresponding to [Math Processing Error]. (In the case where PredictIt's prices do not add up to $1, we will normalize them to $1 to convert to probabilities.)This question resolves positively if the Brier score for the 14 races is lower for PredictIt's probabilities than for fivethirtyeight.com's probabilities, where we will take values as of noon EST on 3/2/2020, and election outcomes as reported on 3/3-3/4.",

    "question": "A revival of interest in muon-catalyzed fusion?",
    "context": "Cold fusion of the late 1980's Fleischmann-Pons variety has long since fallen into disrepute, but it is interesting to recall that the coinage of the term actually dates to a 1956 New York Times article describing the phenomenon of muon-catalyzed fusion.In a nutshell, a muon replaces one of the electrons in a hydrogen molecule (generally of the exotic deuterium-tritium variety), allowing the two nuclei to draw far closer than the normal covalent bond would allow. With proximity thus achieved, the probaility of deuterium-tritium fusion is greatly increased. After a fusion reaction occurs, the responsible muon is free to catalyze further events until it either decays (its rest frame half-life is two microseconds) or is removed from action by \"sticking\" to an alpha particle produced by the fusion. Economic viability of the process for creating energy would require that a single muon catalyze approximately 500 fusion events before it decays, a rate of efficiency that exceeds best efforts by at least a factor of two or three.Muon-catalyzed fusion was originally observed in laboratory experiments and described in this article by Luis Alvarez et al., and was studied in depth by John David Jackson, he of Jackson's Electrodynamics fame. Jackson's 1957 Physical Review article is a standard reference, and remarkably, more than a half-century later, he summarized the history of the field in this 2010 review.The prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion as an energy source seemed moderately bright during the 1980s and 1990s, following the elucidation and observation of molecular states of the deuterium-tritium-muon positive ion. The field has largely stalled in recent years, however, as workable schemes for either producing muons more cheaply, or improving their catalytic efficiency have failed to emerge.At the close of the 2010 article, Jackson seemed optimistic, writing, \"The effort for such a specialized field has been prodigious, especially in the last 30 years. On the applied side, ideas continue on how to increase the number of fusions per muon and design hybrid systems to get into the realm of net energy production.\" Certainly, it is fair to state that development of effective muon-catalyzed fusion for energy production would be a global game changer.Prior to Jan 1, 2020, will a peer-reviewed article appear in the mainstream physics literature which discusses a discovery of a physical phenomenon or which outlines an engineering technique that can either (1) increase the number of deuterium-tritium fusions per muon, or (2) decrease the energy cost of muon production to the point where a break-even reactor is feasible?",

And in July 2019, Oakland, California, became the latest to ban city departments \u2014 including police \u2014 from using facial-recognition technology.According to this Vox article by Sigal Samuel, Kelsey Piper, and Dylan Matthews:Will facial recognition be banned in at least 3 more U.S. cities in 2020?This question resolves positively if at least three U.S. cities pass legislation that bans the local government use of facial-recognition technology before the end of 2020. To count, the relevant legislation needs to be passed, but the bans need not go into effect before the end of 2020.

    "question": "Before 2020-05-17, will at least two public health agencies claim that China deliberately misreported COVID-19 infections?",
    "context": "The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.This latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.Question: Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2020-05-17?ResolutionThis questions resolves positively if, before 2020-05-17, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:In case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.This question has a long-term sister.",

Using current methods, an algorithm can gain new skills by exposure to large amounts of data, but cognitive abilities that could broadly generalize to many tasks remain elusive. This makes it very challenging to create systems that can handle the variability and unpredictability of the real world, such as domestic robots or self-driving cars.  Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, creator of the Keras neural network library, in the paper \"On measuring intelligence\" describes in detail the context and motivation behind a benchmark that is supposed to put the general, broad intelligence of machines to test.  The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) provides a benchmark to measure AI skill-acquisition on unknown tasks, with the constraint that only a handful of demonstrations are shown to learn a complex task. The setup is similar to the Raven's Progressive Matrices IQ test. You can inspect training examples  here.

    "question": "Will Planet Nine be Discovered by mid-2019?",
    "context": "Two years ago, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- kicked the news media into high gear by predicting the existence of Planet Nine, a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. Their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the planet count back up to nine.Batygin and Brown's paper, has been downloaded more than half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for Planet Nine. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.Follow-up papers by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. During the past two years, Planet Nine has been invoked as an explanation for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been shown that it can account for curious orbital commensurabilities among the most distant members of the Kuipier Belt, and it has been hypothesized that it can explain the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator. If it does exist, the most likely sky location for Planet Nine is roughly RA=2h, Dec=0 deg, near aphelion (although the uncertainty on this direction is substantial). The favored area of the sky is optimally visible during late autumn for a planet at opposition. At the most probable current location, the planet's current distance would be r~950 AU, and the expected V magnitude is 22.4. A number of groups have engaged in the hunt, and there is something of an emerging consensus that if the planet exists to be found, it'll be found sooner rather than later. As an example, Mike Brown gave sixteen months fifteen months ago. This fourth update to our original, now closed, Planet Nine question is thus in order:Will the discovery by direct observation of a new solar system planet having characteristics substantially similar to those described in the Batygin-Brown paper, be announced in a peer-reviewed paper prior to July 1, 2019?(For this question to resolve as \"Yes\", the new solar system planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, an orbital period greater than 5,000 years, and an orbital eccentricity e > 0.25).",

This would predate by more than 1000 centuries the current general consensus that humans reached North America only around 25,000 years ago at earliest.As nicely detailed in this National Geographic piece, other researchers are skeptical of the study, citing the absence of the tools themselves or other corroborating evidence.So will this evidence for a (much) earlier hominid species in North America turn out to be true? To get at this we'll ask the following:By start of 2020, will an additional site be discovered in California, dated to prior to 50,000 years ago and indicating Hominid presence, with an analysis published in a peer-reviewed journal that cites this discovery as evidence for the Dem\u00e9r\u00e9 paperORBy start of 2019, will more than two additional and independent (no shared authorship) analyses of the Dem\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. site's findings, published in peer reviewed journals, argue on the balance in favor of hominid presence prior to 100,000 BC in California.",

Over the years, tensions have continued to persist resulting in incidents such as clashes in 1967 and a military standoff in 2017.On May 5th of this year, tensions flared again when Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed along the western border.

The North Korean Government has, however, enacted a strict policy of quarantining persons entering the country found to be exhibiting signs of a fever. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also indicated that they do not have any evidence of an outbreak of COVID-19 in North Korea, though South Korean media has claimed that such an outbreak is indeed occurring, and news of it being repressed by the North Korean Government.Regardless of whether the possible pandemic has reached North Korea already, such temperature-based quarantines are of indeterminate effectiveness. A growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 may be transmissible by asymptomatic carriers, rendering symptom-based quaratine measures effectively useless.Thus, there are two questions of relevance to North Korea: first has or will COVID-19 reach its population in spite of the quarantine measures, and second, will the North Korean government affirm the breach? Alternately, will the WHO confirm a North Korean outbreak, regardless of whether the North Korean government announces it? Stated more succinctly,Will the WHO or North Korean Government confirm any COVID-19 cases in North Korea by 2020-05-17?This question resolves negatively if on 2020-05-17, no public announcements or press releases by either the WHO or North Korean government have been issued affirming that any cases of COVID-19 have been discovered in North Korea.

Reserve balances are amounts held at the Federal Reserve to maintain depository institutions' reserve requirements. Institutions with surplus balances in their accounts lend those balances to institutions in need of larger balances. The federal funds rate is an important benchmark in financial markets.The federal funds target rate is determined by a meeting of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee; these normally occur eight times a year about seven weeks apart. The Committee may also hold additional meetings and implement target rate changes outside of its normal schedule.As of 18 September 2019 the target range for the federal funds rate is 1.75\u20132.00%.

In 2012, an international group of neuroscientists released \"The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness,\" arguing that nonhuman animals (including all mammals, birds, octopuses, and some others) possess the neurological substrates that generate consciousness, and that consciousness and intentionality are not uniquely human attributes.In the US, there is some federal legislation recognising some aspects of animal sentience in some animals. In particular, the preamble to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 explains that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering, thereby acknowledging this capacity in non-human animals. However, the legislation does not extend to poultry, fish, rabbits or other animals routinely slaughtered for food.[1]In China, the recognition of non-human animal sentience is very limited: according to Wold Animal Protection, only a couple Chinese legislative articles refer to the humane treatment of animals and measures to ensure that the animals in question do not suffer, whereas most articles regulating the treatment of animals do not.In 2017, the USA produced the most beef and veal, and poultry in the world, whilst China produces the most Pork in the world.[2]The US received a D and China received an E in WAP's 2014 index.Will the Animal Protection Index award either the USA or China with a higher grade than received it in the 2014 index for its recognition of animal sentience by the end 2022?ResolutionThis question resolves positively if either the USA receives a grade of C or above, or China receives a grade D or above (or both), in the second edition of the Animal Protection Index, planned to be released in early 2020.

    "question": "Will Michael Bloomberg emerge as the leading moderate candidate after Super Tuesday?",
    "context": "Former Mayor of New York City and current Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg (b. 1942) has mounted a campaign with no precedent in US history. For one thing, he has refused to accept contributions and is instead self-funding his campaign; since entering the race in December last year, he has outspent all the other candidates combined. Because he has received no external funding, Bloomberg was also automatically disqualified from participating in all of the primary debates. In addition, Bloomberg has chosen not to compete in any of the first four states, regarded by many as critical for building momentum. His strategy is instead to focus on \"Super Tuesday\", the day\u2014March 3rd\u2014when the greatest number of U.S. states hold primary elections and caucuses, and when more delegates are at stake than on any other day during the primaries.Bloomberg's popularity has surged in recent polls; as of February 7th, he is polling at 11% nationally, according to FiveThirtyEight's poll aggregator. Pete Buttigieg, who won the most delegates in Iowa and has also seen a slight increase in popularity after this victory, is still only polling at 8%; while Joe Biden, the frontrunner until recently, had a singularly disappointing election, which may be repeated in New Hampshire, and generally appears to be running out of steam.These three candidates\u2013Biden, Buttigieg and Bloomberg\u2014may be considered the only moderate Democrats running with a realistic chance of winning the nomination. After Super Tuesday, one of them will likely emerge as the leading alternative to democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. A natural test of whether Bloomberg's strategy has succeeded is whether he comes to occupy this position. So we ask: Will Michael Bloomberg win more delegates than Biden and Buttigieg on Super Tuesday?ResolutionThe question resolves positively if Michael Bloomberg obtains more total delegates in the elections held on March 3, 2020 than are won by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg individually. The question resolves negatively otherwise. Failure by a candidate to run in one or more of these elections will be treated as if the candidate had won no delegates in those elections. The elections scheduled to occur on that day are those in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.

Nonetheless, stochastic variations do lend a short-term veneer of unpredictability to near-term measurements.A recently closed Metaculus question that asked whether 2018 will break the global heat record was quite popular -- 458 predictions were registered, with the community of predictors ascribing a median 33% chance of going over the top.

However, the process has been fraught with difficulty and the British government has been unable to win enough support in Parliament to ratify Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiated withdrawal agreement. As a result of the deadlock, the UK has been granted an extension until 31 October 2019 following a Euopean Council meeting on 10 April. If a deal is not reached by this date, the legal default position is that the UK will exit the EU with no deal on this date.At present the UK government is still pursuing a negotiated exit, and it is still possible that the UK can leave the EU with a deal, or leave without a deal. It is also possible that the UK will seek and be granted another extension. It is also possible for the UK to unilaterally revoke its invocation of Article 50 and thereby cease the process of exiting the European Union.This question asks: Will the United Kingdom revoke Article 50 by June 23 2020?This question resolves negatively if the United Kingdom has not revoked Article 50 on or before June 23 2020.

    "question": "By the end of 2019 will a gene drive targeting malaria be initiated?",
    "context": "\"Gene drives\" are phenomena in a species' population in which one version of a gene, or allele, is probabilistically favored over other alleles that are otherwise equally favored by fitness. A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait.With new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes engineered gene drives tractable: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being \"driven,\" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one \"wild\" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited. This process can spread the driven gene expoentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival.Uses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. Valentino Gantz et. al. have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the Anopheles stephensi mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another study published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated engineering mice (a prime carrier) to be immune to Lyme disease.With Malaria afflicting hundreds of millions of people per year, advances in gene drive research have insitgated public conversation about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives is being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems.By January 1st, 2020, will a credible reports indicate that a formal submission has been made to a regulatory body proposing to test a malaria-combatting gene drive in a wild population?For positive resolution, the drive need not targeted for the US or home country of the researchers (indeed this is unlikely), but must be done under the purview of some regulatory body so that in principle parameters and details of the drive are provided and (potentially) approved by some authority. The drive itself need not be initiated to count. The wild population can be isolated (say on an island or even in an enclosure) to control spreading but should aim to replicate natural reproduction etc., and cannot be a laboratory setting.",

    "question": "A medical pathway to complete painlessness?",
    "context": "The scientific community has--for over a decade--recognized that the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 protein, which is found in neurons among nearly every type of human tissue, is primarily responsible for pain sensing in mammals. Small-molecule inhibitors of this channel, however, fail to completely shut off the pain response in humans. Mysteriously, a non-functional mutant of this protein homologue in mice has been shown to achieve painlessness. Since then, a number of drugs with marginal success have been developed by multinational healthcare companies, including Roche and Biogen.A recent study has revealed a novel function of Nav1.7 that may present a possible new target for drug therapies against chronic pain. According to scientists from the lab of Dr. John Wood at University College London, deletion or deleterious mutation of the Nav1.7 gene in mice caused the expression of opiate-simulating proteins (\"opioids\") to be up-regulated--a contribution to their painlessness not observed in humans. A Nav1.7-lacking, pain-insensitive human subject, after being given opioid blockers, was able to feel pain for the first time. A combined treatment with opioids in addition to Nav1.7 blockers in mice proved to have the expected opposite effect: a complete suppression of the pain response.The newly-discovered treatment apparently works, but still remains somewhat impractical. While relatively small, biologics like opiods are fairly difficult (and therefore expensive) to produce, store, distribute, etc. Other options would be geneitc modification or, more commonly, a small-molecule substitute--specifically, one that will inhibit the opiod-regulating function of Nav1.7, either directly or indirectly. Regardless of treatment options, the discovery has the potential to significantly change the way we approach pain management.By 2020, will a US clinical trial begin in which the goal is a temporary or permanent complete inhibition of the pain response in a human?For a positive resolution, there must exist by Jan 1, 2020 a clinical trial in the US database with a start date prior to Jan 1, 2020, which aims to use the Nav1.7 channel to completely suppress the human pain response in part or all of the body.",

Therefore, SpaceX is currently focusing on the upper stage (currently called \"Starship\" and before that Big Falcon Spaceship or BFS).For those losing track of Musk's repeated renaming of the project Wikipedia provides up-to date section on BFR nomenclature.About renaming BFR to Starship, Musk's has said:All rockets capable of reaching Earth's orbit with useful payload are built with at least two stages. Sometimes more. This is due to Rocket Equation. Dumping the dead weight of an empty first stage allows for more efficient use of energy. Super Heavy Starship (or BFR) is also built with two stages: the first stage is called \"Super Heavy\" and the second stage is called \"Starship\" (or BFS).An interesting aspect of the Starship is that it will be able to fly without the Super Heavy. That will allow it to return from other planets and moons to the Earth. It will also be capable of single stage to orbit launch from the Earth without any useful payload. The capability is intended to be used for testing of entering planets atmospheres from super orbital velocities like Mars/Moon transfer velocities. According to Musk there are certain heating parameters that scale to the eighth power with regard to speed.See Musk's explanation of how Starship will be tested.Recently we got the first fan made photos of a test vehicle being assembled in Texas.Musk confirmed:Previously the Starship was supposed to be built using composite materials, but the current design is using stainless steel.Scott Manley has nice discussion of the new approach.Will SpaceX start testing a Starship (BFS) before 2020?The question will resolve positively if we get information from SpaceX in the form of a video or a photo showing that any early test version of Starship/BFS (the second or upper stage) has been launched before 1 January 2020.

Certain labs are designated as \"select agent labs\" and are part of this program (though apparently even the CDC is not entirely clear which labs are in the program; see the rather disturbing investigative report by USA today.)A significant concern is theft of these select agents, which could potentially be used in a bioterror attack or as raw materials for a more sophisticated attack.By 2020 will a credible journalist or government source disclose that a viable sample of a Select Agent has been stolen from a (or during transport to/from) a US Select Agent lab?Here we will leave a relatively low burden-of-proof as to whether a lab is a designated Select Agent lab, and assume that a reasonably sophisticated university, government or industry lab doing research with Select Agents is such a lab.

In 2008 a constitutional amendment allowed Bouteflika to run for and win a third term, under protest and boycott from opposition parties.Bouteflika suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013, but that didn't stop him from running for a 4th term in 2014. During that campaign and after his win, with far smaller participation numbers anbd under boycott from opposition parties, he was seen less and less in public.He announced his candidacy for the 2019 election via press release, which resulted in protest, internet censorship, the retraction of his candidacy and an unspecified postponement of the election.Now the protesters seek Bouteflika to be deemed unfit, which would result in the President of the Senate and incidentally friend of Bouteflika, Abdelkader Bensalah, becoming Acting President for the 90 days until elections would be held.Interestingly enough, these demands are supported by Army Chief of Staff Ahmed Gaid Salah, himself a powerful man in the state.Will Algeria hold Presidential Elections in 2019?Resolves positive when such elections are held before 2020.",

    "context": "Given the dramatic advances in our ability to understand and modify the genome of organisms, the idea of a pathogen that has been genetically engineered (rather than artificially selected) to increase its virulence, transmissibility, or scope of effect is a rapidly growing concern.As discussed in this question, researchers have successfully \"upgraded\" H5N1 to be airborne, using techniques that could also be applied to MERS and SARs \u2014 all pathogens with high virulence but low transmissibility. One could also imagine increasing the virulence of highly-transmissible flus or other illnesses. Techniques used by these groups have been published and are thus available to other researchers with sufficient expertise.Bioweapons research on large scales is outlawed by the Bioweapons Convention, but this did not prevent the Soviets from following a massive program into the 1980s and perhaps 1990s, and it is quite possible that clandestine programs exist today using more modern techniques.Genetic engineering also opens up possibilities that do not exist in nature or earlier research efforts. For example, pathogens could be engineered to attack people with genetic markers strongly correlated with particular races or types of ancestry (as so-called \"ethnic bioweapon\"). An agent might even target an individual person's genome.As these techniques grow more powerful and accessible, we ask how likely is such an attack, which would combine ability to genetically engineer pathogens with intent to cause harm (or at least act without consent):By 2020 will a human be deliberately infected (without their consent) by a pathogenic virus genetically engineered to increase its virulence, transmissibility, or scope of effect?The question resolves as positive whether or not the attack is successful, but should be termed an attack: deliberate and unfriendly.

Under Kim Jong-un, more than 80 tests have been undertaken.2017 saw tensions reach perhaps their highest level ever after dozens of missiles were tested over a period of several months, including multiple missiles launched over Japanese territory, and the launch of ICBMs believed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the United States mainland.United States President Donald Trump, speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, then warned that the United States would \"totally destroy North Korea\" if forced to do so.As of December 20 2018, the most recent North Korean ballistic missile launch took place on November 28, 2017 when North Korea launched an ICBM from the vicinity of Pyongsong at 1:30pm EST/3:00am Pyongyang time. The rocket traveled for 50 minutes and reached 2800 miles (4,500 km) in height, both of which were new milestones.In 2018,North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un met with United States President Donald Trump and signed an agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.However, on 20 December 2018, North Korea announced \"it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States removes its nuclear threat first,\" raising further doubts as to whether Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un will ever relinquish an arsenal he may see as his greatest guarantee of survival, and raises the spectre of a return to sabre rattling.This question asks: Will North Korea launch, for any reason, an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2019?This question will resolve as positive when a guided missile with a range of more than 5,500 km, capable of hosting a nuclear warhead, is launched by the North Korean government. Resolution is by credible media report, with assessment provided by US or UK government or United Nations or by confirmation of any any permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council. (In case of major controversy in such assessments, resolves as ambiguous.)This question closes retroactively 24 hours before any such launch occurs, in the event that it is still open for predictions if and when such an event takes place.",

    "context": "NeurIPS is widely regarded as the leading conference in machine learning. Held every year, it attracts large numbers of attendees, causing tickets to sell out within twelve minutes last year. Around the world, ML researchers furiously scramble to prepare papers in time to submit, as NeurIPS is also regarded as the most prestigious publication venue in ML.Each year, once the list of accepted papers is released, people invariably calculate which institutions and authors have contributed the most papers, or the most first authorships. One relatively easy-to-check stat is for each institution, how many accepted papers have an author affiliated with that institution. In 2017 (when the conference was called NIPS) and 2018, the top institution was Google Research, by a large margin. However, the university rankings are somewhat more competitive: in 2017, Carnegie Mellon (CMU) was at the top, while in 2018, MIT took the lead. CMU also does well at the other leading ML conference, ICML, where it took top or equal top spot among universities in both 2017 and 2018.In this question, we ask:Will CMU be the university with the largest number of papers accepted to NeurIPS 2019 with at least one author affiliation?Note that the question will resolve yes if CMU is tied for first place on this metric. Question closes when NeurIPS 2019 submissions are due, and resolves when a list of accepted papers with author and affiliation information is released.

    "question": "Will Jordan Peterson endorse Maxime Bernier as Canada's next Prime Minister ahead of the 2019 Canadian federal election?",
    "context": "Canada is heading into a federal election in the fall of 2019. Recently, there has been a fracture in the Conservative Party of Canada: the libertarian-leaning MP from Quebec, Maxime Bernier, left the party over complaints that it is \"morally and intellectually corrupt\" and beholden to special interest groups whom they serve at the public's expense. Bernier's acrimonious departure came after the Conservative Party caucus \u2014 mostly notably leader Andrew Scheer, who beat Bernier by two percentage points during a 2017 leadership race \u2014 distanced themselves from him in the wake of blowback to his comments addressing what he called the ruling Liberal party's policies of \"extreme diversity\".Bernier has declared his intentions to form his own federal political party and field candidates in all 338 of Canada's federal ridings. He enjoys considerable grassroots support. A poll of a thousand Canadians shortly after he announced his intention to form a party found 13% of Canadians intended to cast their vote for its candidates. While this is an impressive start, it's clear that Bernier has an uphill battle ahead of him in order to ascend to the Prime Ministership, or even to the Leader of the Official Opposition, a position currently occupied by his formal rival Scheer.One big boost to Bernier's candidacy would be an endorsement from Canadian intellectual Jordan Peterson, who is arguably the most well-known and popular intellectual in the Western world today. His work \u2014 which is often articulated in bombastic popular lectures \u2014 covers topics such as free speech, identity, anti-totalitarianism, personality, performance, and religion, among many others. Peterson's reach is considerable: his lectures have been viewed nearly 70 million times on YouTube, and his new book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over half a million copies.Peterson and Bernier have crossed paths before. Bernier cited a meeting with Jordan Peterson has having changed his mind on endorsing Bill C-16, which amends the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include the terms \"gender identity\" and \"gender expression\". He met Peterson again and was photographed with him this past April at an event in Montreal, where he says the two of them spoke on the topic of freedom of speech.Peterson considers himself to be a \"classical liberal\", while Maxime resists political labelling but has suggested he himself might reasonably be called a freedom-loving fiscal conservative, or a \"reasonable libertarian\". Both share a dislike for the policies and perspectives of the current Prime Minster, Justin Trudeau, and his Liberal Party.While there is perhaps not much political space between Bernier and Peterson, its not clear that Peterson is in the business of offering political endorsements. He seems not to have made any publicly during the 2015 Canadian federal election. He did say, when asked, that he would be open to endorsing candidate Tanya Granic Allen during the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's leadership race earlier this year, but no such endorsement ever came. That said, he clearly has an interest in politics, and even considered running in the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's leadership race after the previous leader Patrick Brown resigned amidst allegations of sexual misconduct.Peterson's ideas have already had a large impact on Canadian politics at the federal and provincial level. It no doubt informed the pushback among federal Conservatives on Bill C-16, and has fueled the concerns of both federal and provincial conservatives regarding the challenges to freedom of speech on the country's university campuses.Jordan Peterson will be considered to have \"endorsed\" Maxime Bernier if he declares in a public statement or utterance that he endorses him to be Canada's next Prime Minister. Nothing short of an unequivocal endorsement \u2014 such as Peterson mentioning Bernier or his policies favourably in the media \u2014 will suffice.",

    "context": "Since the 1990s, the Tropical Race 4 strain of Panama disease has been destroying banana crops around the world. The fungus (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense) operates as a soil pathogen, infecting the banana plant through its root system. It is easily spread through the transportation of contaminated dirt, and there is no known cure. Tropical Race 4 was first detected in Taiwan and has since spread across southeast Asia as well as northern Australia, Mozambique, Jordan, Pakistan, and Lebanon.The fast and widespread progression of the disease has a historical precedent. In the first half of the nineteenth century, an earlier variant of Panama disease wreaked havoc on the export banana plantations of Latin America and the Caribbean, which were dedicated to the growth of a single species, the Gros Michel. After the near-extinction of Gros Michel, production shifted to the Cavendish, a more resistant banana. Representing 99% of the global banana market, the monoculture of the Cavendish renders the world\u2019s supply of the fruit particularly vulnerable to diseases like TR4. TR4 has the potential to wipe out not only the Cavendish, but many local varieties of banana and plantain that are crucial to the diets of people around the world.TR4 has not been detected in the Americas, but scientists warn that it is likely to disseminate further via the spread of contaminated plant material, soil, tools, or footwear.

    "context": "The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was one of the most successful arms control agreements in recent history. Signed in 1987 by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev, the treaty called for disarmament of all nuclear and conventional missiles and their launchers with ranges between 500\u20135,500 km (310\u20133,420 mi), excluding sea-launched missiles.After 20 years, both signatories started to allege the other was violating the treaty. Russia supposedly by developing the SSC-8 cruise missile, and the US by opening bases in Rumania and Poland. The US' increased use of armed drones is also claimed to be in violation of the treaty.In late 2018 President Trump declared his intention to withdraw from the treaty, citing both Russia's violation and China's arms build-up.Thus we wonder: Will the INF treaty functionally continue past 2025?Keep in mind, expanding the treaty to include more signatories, or having it replaced with a slightly different treaty (\u00e0 la NAFTA turned USMCA) would still be interpreted as functionally continuing.",

    "context": "MIT researchers Kadambi et al have developed a 3D imaging system called Polarized 3D that integrates the polarization of light in its rendering of depth maps. Incorporating polarization into enhancing a map of a 3D surface hasn't been engineered before, and the advantage it offers is additional information about the geometry of physical objects based on the way polarized light interacts with their surfaces. For example, specular highlights on objects often lower the rendering capability of computer vision algorithms, but it can be subtracted from objects in computer vision by using polarization filters.The obvious focus for applications of Polarized 3D is in the 3D camera and printing industry. Less obvious is whether this technology can be used on driverless and autonomous cars, most of which require stereoscopic camera arrays as part of their object detection and depth sensing. Self-driving cars do well in fair conditions, but in high precipitation environments, water helps create a variety of optical aberrations that throw off an autonomous car's vision algorithms. In particular, those specular highlights mentioned earlier get amplified on various surfaces in rainy conditions, and subtracting them out would allow for a more accurate depth map.Will an autonomous vehicle project, like the Google Self-Driving Car, integrate light polarization technology into their 3D vision systems by 2019?This question will resolve positively if there is an article published by a top media news outlet, or if a public release is made by an autonomous vehicle developer stating that Polarized 3D (or a closely-related system) is being used to enhance the computer vision systems on a production-model autonomous vehicle.",

    "context": "In April of 2015, it was announced that scientists in China had successfully edited the genome of a human embryo using the CRISPR/Cas9 system--a standard synthetic biology tool for gene editing. February 1st of this 2016 marked another major turning point in the field when UK regulators approved gene editing in viable human embryos. This is the first time that any kind of regulatory agency has approved the use of synthetic techniques in humans at the embryonic stage. This may present an open door for other agencies to make similar judgments. It should be noted that the genes targeted in the newly-approved study were chosen by the UK researchers to probe embryonic development, and specifically disapproved for future implantation and maturation.Single-cell embryos are excellent subjects for CRISPR research; their relatively large size enables routine microinjection of the biological macromolecules necessary to perform the edit. A significant drawback, however, is CRISPR efficiency. Like any mutagenic process, it leaves a lot of room for improvement. Its targets still have a low chance of being successfully and appropriately edited, thus requiring a sequencing screen to find a match. This has the potential to leave many human embryos unwanted or no longer viable, as in the relatively rare case of an improper edit.On the other hand, there are a number of genetic disorders (cystic fibrosis, for instance) that are rapidly fatal anyway, presenting some cases as prime candidates for CRISPR editing. Now, development of the system in human embryos has precedent, which may lead to other agencies following the example set by the UK. While still strictly illegal in the UK and US,by 2020, will the remaining roadblocks be lifted (or circumvented), leading to an implanted human embryo brought fully to term with CRISPR (or a similar system) edited DNA?This question will resolve positively if the aforementioned event is reported in one of the top 25 media outlets by October 1st, 2020.",

    "question": "Will a poker bot beat the best human players at online multi-player No Limit Texas HoldEm?",
    "context": "Human beings are no longer the best players of the games of Chess or Go, but humans are still fighting the good fight on the poker table. Simple variants of poker have been conquered by the bots, but more complex versions are still being defended.  Texas HoldEm is the most popular form of poker, and its simplest variant (Heads-up Limit HoldEm) is widely believed to have been solved, with poker programs consistently outperforming human players. This variant is simple in two ways: \"Heads-up\" means that there are only two players at the table, and \"Limit\" means that bets and raises can only be made in fixed amounts, with a limited number of reraises.  The least restricted version of HoldEm is multi-player No Limit Holdem, where there are multiple players at a table, and bets/reraises can range freely between a minimum amount and the entire amount of a player's chips. To date in 2016, humans have eked out narrow victories in Heads-up No Limit Holdem, and no computer program has as yet made a serious showing in a multi-player No Limit HoldEm challenge.  This dominance of the felt by humans is no doubt temporary, and victory by the machines is inevitable. When will humans be forced to acknowledge not only that they are descended from fish, but that fish they remain (as far as silicon-based sharks are concerned)?",

Awesome, now let\u2019s talk about a fun topic... death.During the past 98 years, Chuck Hughes is the only NFL player to die on the field during a game. In 1971, Chuck was playing for the Detroit Lions when he had a heart attack on the field. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. It turns out that he had an undiagnosed heart condition (advanced arteriosclerosis) which doctors failed to diagnose (he had been admitted previously complaining about chest pains). His widow filed a lawsuit that was resolved in 1974.For the purposes of this question, we are only considering imminent death that results from an injury sustained on the field. This distinction may seem inconsequential, but if we don\u2019t employ such a clear distinction, then many more deaths could be attributed to playing NFL football. Arguably, concussions received on the field lead to an early demise by contributing to CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy), Alzheimer\u2019s, and Parkinson\u2019s. Consider the recent NFL concussion settlement which includes thousands of submitted claims.This is why, for our purposes, we want to consider only imminent death from an injury sustained on the field and not the long term consequences of playing football.To recapitulate, we are interested in whether or not an NFL player dies during a game during the 2018-2019 season. The regular season began on Thursday, September 6. The season ends upon crowning a victor at Super Bowl LII on February 3, 2019.Question is resolved as positive if a credible news agency reports that an NFL player dies during a game by February 3, 2019 at 11:59 PM (Eastern Standard Time).",

Earth has something of a streak going -- the last three years have all been global temperature record setters.There is unambiguous evidence that climate change, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (as well as other greenhouse gases), is responsible for the relentless upward trend. Nonetheless, stochastic variations do lend a short-term veneer of unpredictability to near-term measurements.A recently closed Metaculus question that asked whether 2017 will break the global heat record was quite popular -- 327 predictions were registered, with the community of predictors ascribing a median 46% chance of going over the top. Given the interest, it seems reasonable to roll the question out for the coming year:Will 2018 again set a new record? Or will it fall off the recent record-setting pace?This will resolve in the positive if the NASA GISS global average temperature for 2018 is published above that of any prior year for which records exist.

    "context": "Sepsis, also known as blood poisoning, is an infection that spans multiple systems of the body, often leading to loss of blood pressure, organ failure, and death. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals, claiming around 300,000 people per year in the United States. Paul Marik, a doctor in Norfolk, VA developing a new sepsis treatment, says the death rate from the infection is akin to \"three jumbo jets crashing every day.\"Currently, hospitals treat sepsis by administering fluids and antibiotics. Marik's treatment involves a mix of corticosteroids and two vitamins - Vitamin B and Vitamin C. The combination, Marik says, boosts the body's reception of the steroids,which relieve the inflammation associated with sepsis. Marik says he's treated 150 patients with his custom combo now, and only one has died of sepsis.Marik's treatment seems miraculous and potentially transformative in the way sepsis is treated - so naturally and rightfully, physicians are wary. A chief concern is that the treatment hasn't been through a randomized double-blind controlled trial, the gold standard of evaluating medical treatments. In such a trial, patients are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment or a placebo, with neither the patient or the doctor aware of who receives what. One physician stated that with the claims Marik has made, even a small study could corroborate them. Ideally, such a study would be carried out at multiple hospitals to ensure the effect could be replicated.Part of doctors' skepticism comes from the history of sepsis treatments. In 2011, two potential treatments failed due to a lack of clear evidence that they were effective. Both were pharmaceuticals, which proceed through a different approval pathway than Marik's treatment, which does not involve any new drugs, but rather a combination of existing compounds. Marik will have to submit a research proposal for funding, with a review process that could take nine months. Results wouldn't be available for probably two years.But if the treatment is proven effective, it could save millions of lives and reshape medicine's understanding of how the body responds to inflammation.Will a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of Marik's treatment begin before 2019?This question will resolve as positive if a clinical trial registry such as clinicaltrials.gov or a credible news outlet reports that a trial treatment for sepsis involving corticosteroids and vitamins C and D is underway on or before December 31, 2018.",

The interloping object, now officially known as 'Oumuamua (Hawaiian for \"messenger from the distant past\") was discovered by the PanSTARRS monitoring system on October 19th, 2017. It was quickly confirmed to have a strongly hyperbolic trajectory (with heliocentric velocity v~26 km/sec at infinity), and follow-up observations (see also, here) show that it has a rotation period of roughly seven hours, a reddish overall color, and a highly elongated overall shape. Assuming that 'Oumuamua has low reflectivity, its long axis is approximately 400m, and its mass is of order a billion kilograms. Curiously, no sign of coma has been detected, indicating that volatiles such as water ice are not exposed on its surface. These unusual properties have sparked speculation that `Oumuamua is a directed interstellar probe, and various SETI-related efforts are underway to examine it.The detection of `Oumuamua in the face of various observational biases suggests that such objects may pervade the Galaxy, with a number density estimated to be of order one per ten cubic astronomical units. We therefore ask: Prior to January 1, 2019, will one or more additional interstellar objects be observed passing within a sphere of radius 50 AU centered on the Sun?In order for this question to resolve positively, a newly discovered interstellar object must either, 1. be reported in a peer-reviewed journal as having a hyperbolic orbit (eccentricity, e>1) prior to crossing a sphere of 50AU radius centered on the Sun, or 2. receive an \"I\" designation from the IAU Minor Planet Center, or both.",

    "context": "To advance laser physics, European scientists are constructing the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) project, to eventually include four sites and some of the most powerful lasers in the world. Three of the facilities are currently under construction in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania, while the fourth site is yet to be determined.Each facility is a \"pillar\" of the ELI. The Czech facility, called ELI-Beamlines, will develop short-pulse radiation sources. ELI-ALPS (Attosecond Light Pulse Source), in Hungary, will feature lasers with short pulses and high repetition rate over a broad range of frequencies. The Romanian facility will be called ELI-NP (nuclear physics) and will use the most powerful laser in the world to explore basic nuclear physics and develop applications such as destruction of nuclear waste or cancer radiotherapy. All three sites are slated to be operational by 2018.Construction of ambitious physics facilities can be fraught with difficulties and delays, however. CERN's Large Hadron Collider, for example, was initially expected to be completed in 2005, but operations did not commence until 2009. The National Ignition Facility in California was originally estimated to be completed in 2002, but also experienced delays until dedication in 2009.Will the first three pillars of ELI be completed as scheduled in 2018?For this question to resolve as positive, an ELI press release or report from a credible news outlet must report that the last of the three pillars is complete and operational (taking at least test data using essentially the full system) on or before December 31, 2018.",

    "context": "Industry \"disruption\" is a Silicon Valley buzzword. Companies like Netflix and Uber have upended (or just plain ended, in the case of movie rentals) entire industries. Such disruption rarely comes without pushback or controversy, however.Rentberry is an auction-style market for rental properties. Users submit bids of the price they're willing to pay for monthly rent and security deposit, and landlords decide which bid to accept. The company started in the San Francis area, where median rents for a one-bedroom apartment can top $3,600 per month. Although Rentberry claims that users pay around 4% less for apartments by using the app, an auction framework in a tight market tends toward driving prices up.Rentberry's business mode drawn some level of ire from various directions. Journalists covering the business have expressed distaste at the prospect of bidding wars and the demise of a semblance of affordable housing in hot urban markets.Beyond the gut reaction, however, Rentberry may be violating federal law. The Fair Housing Act is designed to prevent housing discrimination for protected classes. Landlords' choice of which bid to accept could result in allegations of discrimination.As happened with Uber and Airbnb, cities could act to bar or curtail Rentberry in their cities, cutting off access to the priciest and most lucrative pool of apartments.Other factors could also spell Rentberry's demise, such as a change in market conditions. The company makes money off of a $25 \"success fee,\" so a marked downturn in rental applications could hurt the revenue stream. Alternatively, runaway success could lead to Rentberry's buyout.With all of these possibilities in mind: Will Rentberry still be in operation with its current business model in 2019?This question will resolve as positive if the current model of auction-style bidding for apartment is still the operating mode of Rentberry, and that Rentberry is still an operating company, on December 31, 2018. If Rentberry is bought out but still operating under the \"Rentberry\" brand and under the same business model, this will also count as a positive resolution, but if bought out and subsumed into some significantly different effort resolution will be negative.",

Attacks in the US in 2001 were successful but small-scale. (It has been asserted but not proved by the US government that these were carried out by a microbiologist and biodefense researcher.) A large-scale attempt in Tokyo by the Aum Shinrikyo cult in 1993 might have been disastrous, but it appears that the cult accidentally used an attenuated vaccinating strain and inadvertently but fortunately immunized rather than killed a large number of Tokyo's citizens with anthrax.A terror group combining the resources of the Aum Shinrikyo cult with professional-level expertise and viable samples of bioterror agents could lead to truly terrifying results. A number of pathogens and biologically-created toxins have been evaluated for use as bioweapons (see this publications for a list and some background.) Some of these agents, as well as some others, have been more highly weaponized in previous bio-warfare programs of which the Soviet Union's was a prime example.By 2019 will a credible journalist or government source report that a designated terror group has acquired a viable sample of any of the viral or bacterial agents listed in Table 1 of this publication or this list or obtained any of the weaponized agents from this listing, or created/obtained a usable supply of any of the toxins listed in the former table.A viable sample would be one that could be used to generate more of the pathogen in the lab (e.g. with Anthrax) or could provide human-to-human transmission (e.g. for Smallpox). For positive resolution, the report must take place after question opening time, and the acquisition must take place at a time reasonable inferred to be not earlier than one year prior to opening time.Update 6/27: added an additional list of potential agents.",

The trial is scheduled to end October 2017.Research on the health effects of vitamin D, which humans primarily obtain from exposure to sunlight, has yielded mixed results, with strong claims being made by both advocates and skeptics. Some studies show inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and a range of diseases including cancer and diabetes; others indicate no significant connection.

This is still relatively small compared to ~$20B in 3rd quarter venture capital raises in 2017, but the proportion is rapidly rising.Coin offerings have three apparent contributors to their success. First, blockchain-related startups are a dynamic field, and ICOs for coins that provide utility in blockchain-based ventures are thus getting attention and funding. Second, even in companies whose business is not centrally blockchain-based, ICOs are providing a novel form of crowd-based participatory investment, requiring much less effort and paperwork than venture funding so that investment and participation is open to a community of people rather than a relatively small number of early-stage investors. Third, of course, the fact that cryptocurrencies have been rapidly rising of late has led to a great deal of speculative purchasing of coins based on the (quite unreliable) assumption that they will appreciate.Given that Metaculus is a crowd-based concern with a knowledgeable and (to some degree) crypto-savvy community, and already has an onsite token, it is a natural candidate for a coin offering. On the other hand, Metaculus is run by careful and risk-averse founders who are intimately in touch with the extraordinary unpredictability and volaility of the cryptocurrency field.

InSight, and the InSight Mars lander, is the 12th standalone Discovery Program mission managed at NASA JPL. It's purpose: investigate the seismic activity of Mars by drilling to position a seismomitor a few meters under the martian surface.The InSight probe would have been mission-ready this March if not for mechanical failures on the craft and budget constraints. The failure was a leak in the vacuum chamber that contains the seismometer's sensors, discovered last December, and costing at least $150M to fix and exceeding the overall budget of $625M.Even with the budget constraints, NASA announced on March 9, 2016 that the repairs would be carried out and the launch would be rescheduled for May of 2018. Given that there was a failure during the course of development of this craft, and the success history of Mars missions is known, what can be said about the likelihood of success for the InSight probe?Note that the probe must be mission-ready by May, otherwise it will miss the critical launch window when Mars and Earth are closest in their orbits, and the mission will have to wait another 26 months.Will the Insight Mars probe land safely on the Martian surface by January 1st, 2019?",

    "context": "Among their many irritating qualities, mosquitos act as highly efficient carriers of disease. Malaria, caused by the plasmodium protozoa, is the prime and widespread example, with approx. 200M cases in 2014 leading to approx. 440K fatalities in 2015, according to the WHO. Mosquito-borne viral illnesses include Yellow Fever, Dengue Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile virus, and a host of others.Many mosquito-borne illnesses are have been known since ancient times, but some new ones are regularly discovered. The Zika virus, first isolated in the 1950s in humans, has recently become a major health threat, and is the subject of several other questions. While Zika has an even lower mortality rate than malaria (its larger threat being to the as-yet-unborn), other recently-emerged pathogens could be worse. For example, Eastern Equine Encephalitis discovered in the 1930's, has a much higher fatality rate of ~30% (fortunately its prime carrier mosquito feeds almost exclusively on birds.)An illness that spreads like Zika or Malaria but with a relatively high fatality rate could be a huge public health threat.By 2018 will the CDC, WHO, or a published scientific paper report that a naturally-occurring qualitatively new mosquito-borne pathogen with a potential death rate of > 2% has been discovered?We'll consider a pathogen \"qualitatively new\" if it is given a unique new name or official nomenclature and widely described as \"new.\" We define a \"potential death rate of X\" as being fulfilled by any report of > 100 cases in which > X death occurs, or in which > 1 death is reported in a number of reported cases exceeding 100/X. We will consider a pathogen mosquito-borne if the CDC, WHO, or published scientific article verifies that it can be spread from human-to-human via a type of mosquito for which humans are a major food source.",

Congress defines the term \u2018mass killings\u2019 as, \u201cthe term \u2018mass killings\u2019 means 3 or more killings in a single incident.\u201d Some balk at this definition, contending that the threshold is too low. You need more than three victims in order for such a designation to make sense. Note that we immediately moved from mass killings to mass shootings, because gun violence is just that common in America.Perhaps with more data on gun violence in American society we could have a more reasonable definition. This raises another contentious issue in this debate, how do we track the number of shootings? Who is the authority on this data? You might think that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention should have a significant role in monitoring gun violence since many people consider this a public health issue. After all, their motto is \u201cCDC 24/7. Saving lives. Protecting people.\u201d Lest ye forget, this is America:This is known as the Dickey Amendment and it too has become a contentious issue in the national debate about gun control. Fortunately, we can table this issue and proceed with our forecasting.For the purposes of this question we will consider mass shootings with 20 casualties. By casualty we are referring to an individual that is killed or injured during the shooting (and yes, this includes the shooter). This makes for a more interesting question. Note that the recent Jacksonville shooting would not meet the threshold set forth here.Mass shootings, as defined earlier, have become a commonplace event in this American life. The FBI provides reliable data about \u2018active shooters\u2019. According to the FBI, the US endured 20 mass killings in 2016 and 2017. Mass shooting involving more than 20 casualties are rarer. Thus far, we have only had one such event in 2018. The Stoneman Douglas High School shooting claimed 17 lives and included 17 injuries.In 2017, we had two such events. The Las Vegas Massacre in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 in which 58 people were killed and 289 wounded. Also, the Sutherland Springs church shooting on November 5, 2017 in which 27 people were killed (including the shooter and an unborn child) and 20 wounded.Despite the previously mentioned controversy concerning obtaining reliable data about gun violence once we increase the threshold to include 20 casualties it becomes readily apparent how we will resolve our question. A mass shooting with 20 or more casualties will be all over every media site in the hours following such a horrific event. (Question resolves as affirmative if a credible news agency reports that a mass shooting, with 20 casualties) occurred in the United States of America. Depressingly, we all know that another mass shooting will occur, it is simply a matter of when.Closes and resolves retroactively to one day prior to the event should one occur.",

    "question": "Will (some of) China's space station land on land?",
    "context": "Since September 2016, Chinese space officials have known that their space station, Tiangong 1, was going to crash into earth, its orbit not-so-slowly decaying. The station, which has been in orbit since 2011, could burn up in the Earth's atmosphere any time between now and April 2018. The time and location of the station's return to Earth is unknown.It's also unknown how much material will survive re-entry and will land somewhere on Earth. When possible, space agencies direct re-entering spacecraft to an oceanic \"graveyard\" where they can splash down safely. But because Tiangong 1's re-entry is uncontrolled, it's possible that chunks weighing up to 200 pounds could land anywhere on Earth. With around 29% of the planet's surface as land, chances are small (though non-zero) that a sizable piece of debris could cause damage in inhabited areas.Will significant pieces of Tiangong 1 touch down on land?This question will resolve as positive if, following the confirmed atmospheric destruction of the Tiangong 1 space station and prior to June 1, 2019, a piece of debris confirmed to belong to the station and massing > 1 kg is found as having impacted originally on land, according to credible news or governmental reports.(Edit 11/3/17 to add cutoff date for finding the piece.)",

The Deep State is going after Donald Trump, trying to take down his presidency, but he won\u2019t let this coup occur.

However, some believe that Rogers really is Q.Resolution criteria: Will Coleman Rogers be revealed as Q by September 16th?Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and Anonymous will do the dirty work for us and unmask the real Q. Otherwise this could be difficult to resolve. If Rogers has been perpetuating the myth of Q in order to make money then he wouldn't be terribly likely to be forthright about it. Given that difficulty, this question will use consensus forming to create its own answer on whether Rogers is indeed Q (individually, or as a member of a team). Note that the close date will follow the September 16th revelation deadline by two weeks so that we have sufficient time for the community to build a consensus and thus adjudicate.It is important to note that by asking the question concerning the identity of Q, we are missing the point.",

Kavanaugh has already provided thousands of pages of documents [for review.] (https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/21/kav\u2026)Over the last 42 years, excluding nominees like Merrick Garland who did not receive a vote, the confirmation of a Court nominee has taken an average of 67 days Kavanaugh faces the lowest public approval figures of any nominee in more than a decade and considerable opposition from Democratic leaders.Will a new Supreme Court Justice be confirmed by the Senate before November 6, 2018? Kavanaugh need not be the confirmed Justice for question to resolve as positive.",

This enables dramatically simplified genetic editing and engineering relative to recombinant DNA technologies.The CRISPR system has been used successfully in complex organisms including adult mice and embryonic humans.The ease and low cost of CRISPR techniques have opened the doors to the creation of novel organisms both by professional biologists and also by amateur self-described 'biohackers.'

Since its completion in 2007, the ATA has been listening to the skies for clear, repeating radio signals at frequencies that might indicate broadcasts by an intelligent civilization. From 2009-2015, the ATA focused on known extrasolar planets, but found no signals that met the criteria for alien life.Red dwarf stars had previously been dismissed as SETI targets because their chances for hosting habitable planets were thought to be dim. But red dwarves are abundant in the galaxy, and some are closer to the earth than more sun-like stars, meaning that signals from close red dwarves (such as Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our Sun) would be stronger and clearer. As many as one-half of red dwarves may hold planets in the so-called \"habitable zone.\" Research into such possible planets (which would likely be locked with one side facing the star at all times and the other side in eternal night) suggest that oceans and atmospheres could move enough heat around to allow life to develop and thrive. Another plus: red dwarves are old stars, allowing life more time to develop intelligence and technology.By focusing on a certain star type, astronomers will gather a large dataset on red dwarves, possibly uncovering new insights about the star type that will be useful to astronomers, even if a signal of alien life is not found.Will the Allen Telescope Array's survey of red dwarf stars yield valuable scientific information, whether regarding ET life or just the physics of red dwarf stars (or even some other radio sources serendipidously observed)?For this question to resolve as positive, three papers must appear on arXiv.org reporting Allen Telescope Array discoveries regarding red dwarf stars on or before April 1, 2019. More specifically they must have both \"Allen Telescope\" and \"Red dwarf/ves\" or \"K/M dwarf/ves\" in the abstract. At least one of these must arguably report some type of scientific advance, not just null results.

    "context": "One way to measure how quickly the U.S. is striving towards clean energy is the percentage of added electricity generation capacity each year in the form of renewables. The sum total of electricity generation from solar and wind sat at 5.7% in July 2015, but the fraction of added capacity from renewables in 2015 was 69%, according to this Cleantechnica report.To get the percentage of total U.S. electricicty production by solar and wind to the tens of percent necessary to significantly impact carbon emissions it doesn't just mean that more panels and turbines need to be built; wind and solar will have to proportionally overcome energy production from coal, nuclear power, hydroelectric, and natural gas, to dominate the new added capacity for years to come.The sudden momentum boost for newly-added wind and solar energy recently is most likely because they're the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions. Will this trend in renewable energy continue, such that 80% of the added U.S. electricity generation capacity in 2016 comes from solar and wind power?This question will resolve positively if the 2016 Cleantechnica report (see the archive) shows renewables make up for 80% or more of added U.S. electricity generation capacity in 2016.",

Bites are traditionally treated with antivenoms, which are snake-specific, expensive, temperature-sensitive, and often require medical expertise to administer, conditions that make snakebite difficult to treat outside a hospital. An effective antidote, in contrast, would be both heat-stable and broadly effective, interfering with venom\u2019s destructive biochemical effects, which might include paralysis, excessive clotting or bleeding, necrosis, or a combination.Lewin\u2019s research team has identified varespladib and varespladib methyl, off-patent drugs originally developed as an anti-inflammatory, as potential antidotes. These drugs inhibit an enzyme called sPLA2, which is produced in the human body during inflammation and is also a component of snake venom. The drugs have been tested in humans for other uses, but never obtained FDA approval.Early research shows that the drugs are effective in neutralizing sPLA2 in a large variety of snake venoms. In preliminary rodent studies, rats who received varespladib treatments 1-5 minutes after lethal doses of snake venom all went on to survive at least 24 hours. No human trials have yet been undertaken, though Lewin conducted a UCSF-approved trial on himself in April 2013.Will a clinical trial be entered into the US database with a start date prior to 1/1/2018, to test the use of varespladib and/or varespladib methyl as snake venom antidotes in humans?",

(Bioweapons programs, if they exist despite international treaty, are secret and/or classified.)Nonetheless, some research and research publication have encountered criticism for potentially increasing the risk of accidental pandemic, or deliberate bioweapon attack. In a prominent example, in 2012 a Dutch research group published a description of a lab-modified strain of H5N1 influenza virus capable of airborne transmission between ferrets. This came after intense controversy including a recommendation-then-reversal by the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) that the research not be published. See here for summary and an update on the story.Gain-of-function research of the type described in these publications has been under a funding moratorium in the US since 2014; however as detailed in a separate question, the research may be \"allowed\" in some cases in the US, and can continue elsewhere or using alternative funding.This raises questions about the publication of such information, and the responsibility of journals (if any) in deciding whether it should be published. We ask:By 2018 will an event occur in which a credible media source reports that a major medical journal has declined to publish an otherwise-publishable scientific paper on human pathogens due to concerns that it constitutes an information hazard?We will consider any journal in this top 100 list to be a major medical journal.

With this discovery, HD 219134 c ranks as the closest known transiting exoplanet.This announcement seems unlikely to be met with much fanfare in the news media. NASA's Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of transiting planets, several of which are argued to be potentially habitable, and HD 219134 c, with its orbital period of 6.8 days, is anything but. It evokes nostalgia for the turn of the century, when the discovery of even a thoroughly uninhabitable transiting planet was headline news.Transits are scientifically valuable because they enable direct measurements of planetary densities, and they impart clues about bulk and atmospheric compositions. Probing of exoplanetary atmospheres, however, requires bright parent stars. HD 219134, with its mere 6.55 parsec (21.4 light year) distance, is important in this regard because it appears ~10,000 times brighter than many of the host stars of the planets found by the Kepler Mission.Is HD 219134 c the closest transiting exoplanet? At present, a total of 76 stars and brown dwarfs are known to lie within 5 parsecs (16.3 light years) of the Sun. This list of nearest solar neighbors has been growing as objects such as Luhman 16A and 16B -- currently #5 and #6 on the list -- are detected.Prior to Dec. 31, 2017, will a transiting extrasolar planet orbiting a star or brown dwarf within 5 parsecs be announced in the peer-reviewed astronomical literature?",

For several years, an Angry Birds AI competition has been held to evaluate and encourage game-playing ML systems to play Angry Birds.  In this competition the entrants are provided \"a basic game playing software that includes a computer vision module, a trajectory planning module, and the game interface that works with the Chrome version of Angry Birds.\"   Part of the competition is an Man vs Machine Challenge, pitting the best ML systems against highly skilled humans.

    "context": "Making up 85% of the matter in the observable universe, dark matter is, per its name, invisible to us. Its presence is manifested gravitationally, however, as it is required to explain the dynamics of galaxies, clusters, and cosmic large-scale structures, affects the microwave background anisotropies, and can even be mapped using gravitational lensing.Several candidate particles responsible for dark matter have been proposed, but the current front-runners are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). This attractiveness stems largely from the fact that SUSY naturally predicts the existence of a supersymmetric WIMP with kinematic and cosmological constraints consistent with dark matter.Since WIMPs interact with ordinary matter via the electroweak interaction, they can in principle be detected directly in [scattering events with atomic nuclei], among other methods. However, experiments to detect them have only given null results so far.A major ongoing test for WIMP-nucleon scattering is Xenon1T in Italy, with a much higher sensitivity than preceding experiments; this dark matter detector is essentially a 3500 kilogram target of liquid Xenon sandwiched between two arrays of photomultiplier tubes. The arrays will detect signals from scintillation and electron drift generated from particles scattering off Xenon nuclei, at which point known backgrounds will be subtracted out to get the WIMP signal. Xenon1T is expected to start collecting data in spring 2016.Failure to see supersymmetry at the LHC so far, with no sign of WIMPs in direct-detection so far has raised the question as to whether WIMPs deserve their dark matter frontrunner status. But perhaps they will be vindicated soon?By January 1st, 2018, will a paper appear on the physics arXiv or in a refereed journal describing 5-sigma equivalent evidence for dark matter detection in th Xenon1T experiment?[scattering events with atomic nuclei]:",

(Since Herbert Hoover, the average annualized 4-year return during Republican administrations was under 2%, whereas the average annualized 4-year return during Democratic administrations was nearly 11%). This paper from the Federal Reserve emphasizes the ever-salient caution to not conflate correlation with causation.That said, will the S&P 500, as measured by the last traded price of 2017 of the CME E-Mini March 2018 Futures contract, stand above 2,250 at the close of 2017?",

    "context": "Seems like it might be a good time to go into the air conditioner repair business.In 2015, the average global temperature, according to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences (GISS) data analysis, was the warmest on record, handily besting the previous mark which was set way back in 2014.There is unambiguous evidence that climate change, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (as well as other greenhouse gases), is responsible for the relentless upward trend. Nonetheless, stochastic variations do lend a short-term veneer of unpredictability to near-term measurements.A recently closed Metaculus question that asked whether 2016 will break the global heat record was quite popular -- 742 predictions were registered, ascribing an 85% chance of going over the top. Given the interest, it seems reasonable to roll the question out for the coming year:Will 2017 again set a new record? Or will it fall off the recent record-setting pace?This will resolve in the positive if the NASA GISS global average temperature for 2017 is published above that of any prior year for which records exist. As a practical matter, this will be either 2015 or (likely) 2016.",

    "context": "Diabetes affects more than 29 million Americans. It's a disease of the pancreas, an organ that, among other functions, monitors the body's blood sugar levels and releases the hormone insulin as needed to keep blood sugar under control.Diabetes results from a malfunction in the pancreas, requiring people with the disease to monitor their own blood sugar levels and deliver insulin as needed, either through a hypodermic syringe or an insulin pump, which requires user input as to when and how much insulin to deliver.In September 2016, a device from Medtronic gained FDA approval as the first artificial pancreas, an automated insulin pump that automatically carries out blood sugar detection and insulin delivery without the user needing to manually program a pump. It is designed around existing insulin pump technology but with an additional algorithms to automatically regulate blood sugar. This is a boon to people with diabetes, particularly for night-time insulin delivery.Some human input is still required, but only for large meals, exercise, and recalibrating the device with manual blood sugar testing every 12 hours.Medtronic's device is a milestone in diabetes therapy (and resolved a previous version of this question before it even got launched!), but the first artificial pancreas will be far from the last. A device made by Insulet, claims to go up to 72 hours with no user input. Other companies are developing their own devices as well.As of September 2016, Insulet is still enrolling people to participate in its trial study in preparation for their own FDA application.Will an artificial pancreas competitor secure FDA approval by the end of 2017?For this question to resolve as positive, a device manufactured by a company other than Medtronic and intended to serve as an artificial pancreas that automatically delivers insulin based on sensor readings must appear on the FDA's recently approved devices list on or before Dec. 31, 2017.(Updated 10/13/16 to add \"that automatically delivers insulin based on sensor readings\" to resolution criteria.)",

    "question": "Can quantum gravity be interestingly constrained using tabletop experiments?",
    "context": "Modern theories of quantum gravity are generally thought to only be testable at the Planck scale - very high energies or very small distances beyond our current technological scope. However, in the past five years proposals have been made for tabletop experiments for quantum gravity. These experiments won't need to access Planck scale physics; rather, they could use recently successful laboratory techniques (1, 2) for manipulating macroscopic quantum systems, and attempt to observe quantum gravity phenomona in these systems.Italian group Belenchia et al propose using opto-mechanical quantum oscillators to measure a specific predicted effect of quantum gravity. Opto-mechanical oscillators are macroscopic objects, like highly reflective silicone mirrors on springs, whose motions can be controlled by pulses of electromagnetic radiation. Belenchia et al explain that the specific effect to look for is a periodic squeezing, or localization of the oscillating component's position; the overall motion will no longer be simple harmonic oscillation, due to corrections from gravitational effects. Another paper by Australian group Gan et al also outlines the feasibility of testing quantum gravity in an opto-mechanical setting.The design of these flavor of experiments is within technical scope, as claimed by the papers, albeit challenging. The opto-mechanical system must be supercooled into a highly quantum mechanical state and extremely precise measurements of the oscillator must be made. More importantly, the underlying concept's validity still needs to be explored through the peer review process.Can opto-mechanical systems of the proposed type interestingly constrain quantum gravity models?This question will resolve positively if the following are satisfied:(a) either the Belanchia or Gan paper receives 10 or more citations on Google Scholar by the end of 2016(b) an experimental physics paper is published by January 1, 2018 which cites either of the above articles and mentions opto-mechanics to study quantum gravity in the abstract.",

He will cast the deciding vote in a 5\u20134 ruling in Gill v. Whitford that will declare the serpentine redrawing of election districts for political purposes to be unconstitutional.\"Gill v. Whitford is concerned with Wisconsin's 2011 redistricting, which in the 2012 elections gave the Republicans 60% of the seats from 49% of the votes. A District Court decision ruled that the redistricting was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution on the grounds that it deprived everyone but Republicans of \"equal protection\". The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to decide it in mid-2018. The plaintiffs' case is based in part on various measures of gerrymandering, such as the so-called efficiency gap, and if the District Court's decision stands then it will likely make it easier for future gerrymandering cases to be brought on the basis of such measures.The question resolves negative if, by the end of 2018, the Supreme Court upholds the appeal by Gill et al, and positive if, by the end of 2018, the repeal is rejected. In other cases, it resolves ambiguous.Note on resolution conditions and title: In principle the Supreme Court could reject the appeal but deliberately not endorse any particular way of measuring gerrymandering, or could endorse some clear way of measuring gerrymandering that somehow doesn't reckon the Wisconsin redistricting to be a case of gerrymandering. I don't think these are likely enough outcomes for the slight divergence between title and resolution conditions to be a problem, but I'm willing to be persuaded.(edited 12/21/17 plaintiffs -> defendants for consistency with rest of question.)(edited 1/10/17 for further clarifying wording.)",

Independent verifications are required with at least two or more telescopes.The authors have not ruled out other potential explanations, and speculate that the mysterious signal could be due to \"highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.\" But their data came from a small number of stars, centered around the Sun, which have a very narrow spectral range.Currently, the discovery has, according to some commentators, a score of 0 to 1 on the Rio Scale, a ranking system used to evaluate the significance of any observed extraterrestrial phenomena, with 10 signifying a valid and important discovery.Will Borra et al. paper get at least 10 citations in the coming months?The Borra et al. paper was submitted on October 10th, 2016 to arXiv, and was published on October 14th, 2016 by Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP).

    "context": "The 2015-2016 rainfall season brought some relief to California, following several years of well-below-average rain and snowfall. The northern half of the state received more-or-less average rain and snowfall, but the much-vaunted El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation did not live up to expectations for the southern half of the state.The El Ni\u00f1o conditions ended in May, and a band of cool ocean water is now developing in the central and east-central Pacific. This phenomenon is associated with the La Ni\u00f1a flipside of the Southern Oscillation.

It therefore falls on Metaculus to determine whether the drought will be busted in 2016-2017.The severity of regional drought conditions is tracked and updated weekly by the National Drought Monitor. As of June 11, 2016, 42.8% of California's area is classified as experiencing \"extreme\" (code D3) or \"exceptional\" (code D4) drought.

Many current weapons systems, such as military drones, are moving toward autonomy, and autonomous \"swarms\" of aircraft have been tested.  Meanwhile non-military drone technology continues with highly capable drones potentially equipped with facial recognition (and potentially armable) and other narrow AI capabilities becoming cheaper and more effective.    There is significant concern about an arms race in these weapons developing.  An open letter coordinated by the Future of Life Institute and signed by > 3000 AI/ML researchers and 17,000 others argues that  >  If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow. Unlike nuclear weapons, they require no costly or hard-to-obtain raw materials, so they will become ubiquitous and cheap for all significant military powers to mass-produce. It will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists, dictators wishing to better control their populace, warlords wishing to perpetrate ethnic cleansing, etc. Autonomous weapons are ideal for tasks such as assassinations, destabilizing nations, subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group.  International negotiations to potentially limit KLAOWS are underway but dragging.  A formal UN discussions scheduled for late August were cancelled due to technicalities. On August 20, an open letter was released signed by a large number of robotics and AI company CEOs and others encouraging the UN to continue negotiations toward limiting use of KLAOWS.

The past year has seen two significant mergers: between Dow Chemical and DuPont in December 2015, and between Syngenta and China National Chemical Corp. in February 2016.In May 2016, German multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company Bayer approached American multinational agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto with a proposed acquisition. Bayer is a leading producer of pesticides, while Monsanto dominates the global market in seeds and crop genetics; together, Bayer proposed, the companies could create \u201ca truly global agriculture leader.\u201dMonsanto rejected Bayer\u2019s first bid of $62 billion ($122 per share), then rejected a revised bid of $64 billion ($125 per share)\u2014a move some analysts considered overconfident. A top Bayer shareholder floated the possibility of a hostile bid to put pressure on Monsanto, though the company affirmed its commitment to a friendly negotiated deal.In early August, Bayer signed confidentiality agreements to conduct due diligence on Monsanto, a process that is expected to take several weeks. Bayer\u2019s examination of Monsanto\u2019s financial accounts is a crucial step in any possible deal, but no guarantee has been made by either side.The stakes for this deal are high: a merger between these two multinationals is considered the final step of the agricultural sector\u2019s massive consolidation. Critics warn that the merger could have devastating effects on the global food supply and agricultural market. A white paper written by two former employees of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division argues that the deal is \u201cpresumptively anticompetitive\u201d and that it violates a 2008 court order against Monsanto, concluding that \u201cthe antitrust enforcers must not allow this merger to proceed.\u201d The European Commission is also keeping a close eye on the deal and promises to closely examine any merger for violations of European competition policy. In a broader context, Monsanto in particular has long been a target of both legal controversy and popular protest for its large-scale development of genetically modified organisms, the health and environmental effects of its products, and its history of aggressive litigation against small farmers.By March 30, 2017, will Bayer and Monsanto receive final regulatory approval for a merger?This question will resolve as positive if a credible media outlet reports on or before March 30, 2017 that Bayer and Monsanto have been granted approval for a merger from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice and from the European Commission.",

    "question": "What will be the total global production of biofuels (measured in thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day) in 2022?",
    "context": "Biofuels are fuels created from contemporary biomass, as opposed to fossil fuels, that are created from millions-year-old biomass. Biofuels can be made either from crops grown specifically for this purpose or from biological waste. A common example of a biofuel is ethanol made from corn or sugarcane.  Biofuel production has many issues, summarized for example in this video by Real Engineering (with numerous references in the description). In essence, biofuels are just another way of capturing solar energy. However, biofuel production is several times less efficient way of capturing solar energy than e.g. photovoltaic panels (given the inherent inefficiency of photosynthesis, plus the energy consumed by harvesting and processing). In some cases, for example ethanol production from corn, some estimates even claim it to be energy negative (i.e., you get less energy from the biofuel that you put into its production). This should make such production economically unviable. However, biofuel production is heavily subsidized in many countries including the US. An indirect form of subsidy in many countries is biofuel mandates, which require a certain percentage of renewable fuels to be mixed in gasoline sold to customers. In US, this is set by the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard. Currently, US gasoline usually contains about 10% bioethanol, in addition to other renewable fuels.  Biofuel production also has implications for food security. It competes with food production for land area, water and other resources. For example, over 40% of corn produced in the US is used for ethanol production (up from 5% in 2000), decreasing the amount of corn available for feeding people and livestock. This has been blamed for a rise in corn prices. Biofuel production also requires many times more water than other energy production methods (~ 58 m\u00b3/GJ compared to e.g. 0.1 m\u00b3/GJ for nuclear and 0.3 m\u00b3/GJ for solar).",

    "question": "How many countries will have approved the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine on June 30, 2023?",
    "context": "Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, has been a significant global health challenge for centuries.    Efforts to control malaria have primarily focused on vector control strategies, such as insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying, as well as antimalarial drug treatments. While these interventions have significantly reduced the global burden of malaria, the development of an effective and widely available malaria vaccine could be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease.  In 2021, the WHO endorsed the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine, the first of its kind to receive such recommendation.  In April 2023, Ghana and Nigeria approved a new vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, which has shown greater efficacy in trials. The move was unusual as it came before WHO approval. According to the University of Oxford, which developed the vaccine:  >The R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine is a low-dose vaccine that can be manufactured at mass scale and modest cost, enabling as many as hundreds of millions of doses to be supplied to African countries which are suffering a significant malaria burden.   Reportedly, at least 10 other countries are considering approving the R21 vaccine.",

The elections come in the wake of two major earthquakes, and in the context of economic uncertainty, international tension, and challenges to democratic institutions.  In the parliamentary elections, twenty-six parties are competing. Half of them have joined electoral coalitions.  >The ruling People\u2019s Alliance, currently led by President Erdo\u011fan, is composed of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the Turkish ultra-nationalist Nationalist Action Party (MHP) and Great Unity Party (BBP), the Islamist New Welfare Party (YRP) and the Free Cause Party (H\u00dcDA-PAR), and, surprisingly, the Democratic Left Party (DSP), a fringe center-left faction that was once the leading member in a former coalition government (1999-2002).  >The opposition Nation Alliance is also a diverse six-party coalition, representing almost the entire political spectrum: from the center-left Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) and moderate Turkish nationalist Good (\u0130Y\u0130) Party to four minor right-wing parties, including two splinter parties founded by former AKP ministers, the Future Party (GP) and Democracy and Justice Party (DEVA).  >The leftist Labor and Freedom bloc, led by the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), is the second major opposition alliance. It includes six other minor leftist parties, such as the Workers\u2019 Party of Turkey (T\u0130P). Among factions running independently, only the Homeland Party (MP), established by Muharrem \u0130nce, CHP\u2019s former presidential candidate in the 2018 elections who resigned from his former party to run for the presidency again, carries some electoral weight.

Whatever the cause, the Great Resignation adds a layer of complexity to the current US economy: unemployment is reaching 4.2% and businesses face widespread labor shortages, which is leading to inflation on the USD of 6%.",

    "question": "What will the Rotten Tomatoes audience score of the upcoming Super Mario movie be?",
    "context": "Rotten Tomatoes is a website that lists and aggregates critic and audience ratings for movies and seasons of TV shows. Each movie or TV show gets two percentage ratings - a critics' rating which is the percentage of positive critic reviews to all reviews, and an audience rating based on reviews left by people who watch the movie.  One upcoming film of note is the untitled Illumination Studios Super Mario movie, a 2023 film that will feature characters and settings from Nintendo's popular _Super Mario_ franchise. There are several aspects of public opinion that indicate a belief that this movie will be bad.  First, a Super Mario film, released in 1993, was widely panned, receiving a 29% audience score from Rotten Tomatoes. Second, Illumination Studios has been known for some poorly received films such as Hop (53% audience rating) and Minions (49% audience rating).  Third, Nintendo is typically very protective of its IP, especially the Super Mario franchise, which is largely the mascot of the video gaming company. It was unexpected for Nintendo to approve this upcoming movie as it could very well put a negative light on the franchise if it's poorly received.  Fourth, the announced cast was unexpected - Chris Pratt as Mario was one choice that received a lot of feedback, for instance: 1 2 3 4 While Charles Martinet, the voice actor of Mario in many, many Mario series games, could not play the role due to union rules, many people don't expect the character of Mario that they already know to mesh well with Pratt's take on Mario.",

As a result, understanding and mitigating anthropogenic methane emissions is crucial for addressing climate change.  The main sources of anthropogenic methane emissions are agriculture, waste management, and the extraction, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels. In agriculture, methane is primarily emitted by enteric fermentation in the digestive systems of ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, and goats) and by anaerobic decomposition in rice paddies. Waste management contributes to methane emissions through the decomposition of organic waste in landfills and the treatment of wastewater. In the energy sector, methane emissions occur during the extraction, processing, and transportation of natural gas, coal, and oil.

As of late June 2022, this is where the budget process stands according to AAAS ScienceInsider: > Congress divvies up the federal government into 12 pieces for purposes of determining annual spending levels. The House traditionally goes first, with each of a dozen appropriation subcommittees weighing in on the agencies under its jurisdiction.

A parallel committee in the Senate has not yet started the identical process, however, and most observers don\u2019t expect Congress to complete work on the 2023 budget until after the November midterm elections.  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is an office within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for the procurement and development of medical countermeasures.

According to an article in the Washington Post, the situation in Virginia is as follows: >  In Virginia, eviction protections were tied to the commonwealth\u2019s state of emergency. Under that provision, landlords were required to tell delinquent tenants about rent relief programs and were not allowed to file evictions against tenants for nonpayment of rent unless the renter had refused to apply for relief money. According to Pidikiti-Smith, the state provision gave tenants a protective layer at the beginning of the process, forcing the landlord and tenant to work together for relief money. If that step failed, the CDC [nationwide] moratorium served as a backstop to removal. The Virginia protection, however, expired with the commonwealth\u2019s state of emergency on June 30. Currently, landlords are required to provide a 14-day notice before filing an eviction, and tenants who can prove they lost income due to the pandemic can apply for a 60-day delay in the case.  The RVA Eviction Lab tracks eviction statistics in Virginia. Their 2021 second quarter report states the following: > eviction filings, according to our current data, declined from 8,830 in the first quarter to 6,921 in the second quarter...these numbers likely do not capture the true scope of housing instability and evictions in the Commonwealth this past quarter, as they will likely shift upward with more up-to-date court reporting.",

However, measured productivity growth has actually declined by half over the past decade [2]. To some extent, this may be evidence that information technology and other conventional stuff (non-informational inputs or outputs) aren't actually so cheaply or widely substitutable [3].  The prospects of growth of tech and automation may also be constrained by Baumol\u2019s \u201ccost disease\u201d: sectors with rapid productivity growth are able to charge lower prices and subsequently have their share of GDP decline, whilst those with relatively slow productivity growth experience increases in their share of the value contributed to the economy. This might effectively cap the rate of growth of the value of tech as a proportion of the total economy [4].  Brynjolfsson et al. [5] have argued that recent progress in AI and automation might well be radically productivity enhancing, but this might yet go largely unnoticed because of an implementation lag: it takes considerable time to be able to sufficiently harness technologies with broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose technologies.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provided initial funding for a Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA) housed within the U.S. CDC. According to CDC, the following are CFA's key functions: >  - Predict: Undertake modeling and forecasting; enhance the ability to determine the foundational data sources needed; support research and innovation in outbreak analytics and science for real-time action; and establish appropriate forecasting horizons. - Connect: Expand broad capability for data sharing and integration; maximize interoperability with data standards and utilize open-source software and application programming interface capabilities, with existing and new data streams from the public health ecosystem and beyond. - Inform: Translate and communicate forecasts; connect with key decision-makers across sectors including government, businesses, and non-profits, along with individuals with strong intergovernmental affairs and communication capacity for action.  The CFA officially launched in April 2022. The CFA has initial funding of $200 million from the American Rescue Plan Act and as of April 2022 had awarded $26 million in funding to academic institutions and federal partners. CFA plans to eventually have about 100 staff members. However, a potential issue for CFA is that it is unclear whether funding will \"be sustained for the long term\".

This marks 31 consecutive weekly decreases, which is a record since the data series began in 1982. It is down about 12% from a year ago, and represents about 36 days' worth of consumption. The SPR currently accounts for about 57% of total crude oil stocks in the US.  On March 31, 2022 the Biden administration announced a release of 180 million barrels over six months (BBC, White House press release). This is much larger than the administration's two previously announced releases. Compare:  * November 2021: 50 million barrels  * March 2022: 60 million barrels in concert with other IEA members  As EIA explained in 2021-11:  > Crude oil can be released from the SPR under four conditions: emergency drawdowns, test sales, exchange agreements, and nonemergency sales. Emergency drawdowns and test sales are relatively rare. The most recent emergency drawdown occurred in 2011 in response to production disruptions in Libya, and the most recent test sale occurred in 2014. The SPR has released crude oil under exchange agreements 13 times since 1996, most recently after Hurricane Ida earlier this year. In these exchange agreements, crude oil is released to private companies and repaid in kind by specified dates with additional barrels, similar to monetary interest on a loan.",

A plant with a 100% capacity factor, for example, would be capable of producing power 100% of the time.   The capacity power of nuclear energy stands far above the other forms of energy production with a capacity factor of 93.4% in 2019. A capacity factor this high means that constant, reliable, and carbon-free energy can be provided to the nation's population. Part of the reason capacity factors for nuclear energy remain so high is the low necessity for maintenance and the plants\u2019 ability to operate for long periods of time without refueling. This is not possible for plants that produce coal or natural gas, which require frequent maintenance thereby reducing the efficiency of their production processes.   The difference between capacity factors amongst the various forms of energy production also have large implications for the number of plants necessary to produce enough energy to sustain population demand. Based on current capacity factors for natural gas (56.8%), coal (47.5%), or solar PV (24.5%), it would take approximately two gas or coal plants, and almost four solar plants to produce the same amount of energy that a single nuclear plant could within the same time period.",

Thailand's government takes the form of a constitutional monarchy, in which the king is the head of state overseeing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The legislative branch is known as the National Assembly of Thailand), consisting of a 500 member House of Representatives and a 250 member Senate. The executive branch is led by the prime minister (PM), who is elected by a majority vote of the National Assembly. Under Section 269 of the 2017 constitution implemented by the military junta, the current senate was effectively appointed by the junta. This junta appointed senate took office in 2019 and will persist through the 2023 election until the end of its five-year term.  The 250 member senate voted as a bloc for Prayut Chan-o-cha in the 2019 elections, and is again expected to vote for a military candidate in 2023. This creates a significant barrier for a PM from the opposition party to be elected, but recent polling is indicating strong support for the Pheu Thai and Move Forward opposition parties, and the Pheu Thai PM candidate may have a viable pathway to winning the seat.  An analysis from 9DASHLINE suggests the following possible scenarios following the election:  >We predict that three scenarios are plausible: a \u2018status quo\u2019 scenario, where an amalgamation of conservative-leaning, pragmatic, and small parties from the current government reassemble a \u2018new\u2019 government; an \u2018opposition landslide\u2019 outcome, that swaps the current government for the opposition; or \u2018a political crossover\u2019 where key parties from the current government and the opposition team up to form a new \u2018national reconciliation\u2019 government.",

However, with the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic in 2020, global transportation demand has fallen as fewer people travel both domestically and abroad.

The next year, following revelations of potential fraud about Theranos' claims, Forbes had revised its published estimate of Holmes' net worth to zero, and Fortune had named her one of the \"World's Most Disappointing Leaders\".As of September 2021, Holmes is on trial on 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If convicted of any count, Holmes faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.If Elizabeth Holmes is convicted in the Theranos fraud trial, how long will her sentence be?In the event that Elizabeth Holmes is convicted of at least one count of wire fraud or conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with Theranos, this question resolves as the number of months of imprisonment she is sentenced to serve.Note in particular that this question resolves on the basis of the sentence, not on the basis of the actual time that is likely to be served in prison, or the actual time that is served in prison. See examples given in the fine print section for further details.18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3553 governs federal sentencing, including outlining the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, and the application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in imposing a sentence.The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are non-binding rules that set out a uniform sentencing policy for defendants convicted in the United States federal court system.

    "question": "What is the %reduction in the secondary transmission of Delta from infected vaccinated individuals compared to infected unvaccinated individuals, according to the mean of the first 3 relevant studies?",
    "context": "Recently there has been substantial concern that vaccinated individuals may be able to readily transmit the Delta variant given viral load levels that are apparently similar to those of unvaccinated individuals. However, the extent of secondary transmission (onward transmission to others) from vaccinated individuals is almost certainly not equivalent to that of unvaccinated individuals \u2014 though there are no studies on the Delta variant in particular.  Cycle threshold (Ct) values indicate how much SARS-CoV-2 virus an infected person harbors. More precisely, it is the number of amplification cycles needed in a RT-qPCR test for fluorescence to reach a specified threshold. Ct values are inversely proportional to the amount of virus \u2014 meaning the lower a Ct value, the greater the amount of virus is present in the sample since less amplification cycles are needed for the virus to reach the specified threshold. Every ~3.3 increase in the Ct value reflects a 10-fold lower level of virus. Crucially, however, Ct values only indicate the amount of viral RNA, not infectious virus in particular \u2014 for instance, dead viral RNA that has already been neutralized by antibodies and will soon be cleared by the body might constitute detectable viral RNA even while not being infectious viral RNA.  A 30 July study by the U.S. CDC on a large COVID-19 outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts identified 90% of sequenced cases as the Delta variant and found that \u201ccycle threshold values were similar among specimens from patients who were fully vaccinated and those who were not.\u201d Specifically, the median Ct values for the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were 22.77 and 21.54, respectively. A 31 July pre-print by a team in Singapore, where the Delta variant is dominant, finds that \u201cthe initial median CT value did not value did not differ between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated patients...However, fully vaccinated patients had a faster rate of increase in Ct value over time compared with unvaccinated individuals, suggesting faster viral load decline.\u201d Based on this, the authors suggest \u201cit seems likely that vaccination reduces secondary transmission.\u201d  Epidemiological studies of secondary transmission are a way to more straightforwardly ascertain the extent to which vaccination blunts onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of 1 August 2021, there have been no studies that investigate how the secondary attack rate of Delta from vaccinated individuals infected with Delta compares to that of unvaccinated individuals infected with Delta.   However, there have been at least three recent well-done studies that have estimated this in the context of circulation of Alpha, the variant that was most widespread prior to Delta: > - 40-50% reduction in secondary transmission in vaccinated group compared to unvaccinated group - 78% reduction in secondary transmission in vaccinated group compared to unvaccinated group - 41-79%  reduction in secondary transmission in vaccinated group compared to unvaccinated group  If we take the midpoint (45%) of the first study\u2019s estimate and combine it with the 78% point estimate of the second study and the midpoint (60%) of the third study, we get an overall mean of ~61% reduction in secondary transmission of Alpha in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals.",

    "question": "How many Japanese Encephalitis deaths will there be in Australia before July 2022?",
    "context": "Japanese Encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can infect humans. Less than 1% of those infected develop acute illness, but for those that do the fatality rate is around 30%, according to the Australian Department of Health. Pigs and water birds act as amplifying hosts.  On March 3, Queensland recorded the first human case of Japanese Encephalitis in 24 years. It has subsequently spread to the southern states of Australia for the first time. As of March 10, the Department of Health is reporting 15 confirmed human cases of Japanese Encephalitis, and 2 deaths, one in New South Wales and one in Victoria. Vaccine doses are being distributed to at-risk population groups, including piggery workers.  University of Queensland virologist Jody Peters has noted that recent weather events associated with La Ni\u00f1a have created \"excellent environmental conditions\" for the virus to thrive. Wet conditions are expected to increase mosquito population, and water birds have migrated further south due to flooding in northern Australia.  Dominic Dwyer, Director of Public Health Pathology in NSW Health Pathology, noted:  >Only time will tell if this virus is a one-off problem or will become an endemic in eastern Australia, turning up again next summer. We do expect that the arrival of winter temperatures will see a decline in the mosquito population.",

    "question": "What will be the total number of confirmed and suspected monkeypox cases in Europe as of July 1, 2022?",
    "context": "Dozens of reported cases of monkeypox have been reported outside of areas in sub-Saharan Africa (namely, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo) in which it is endemic. As of 12PM EST on 19 May, there are 75 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases across the UK, Portugal, Spain, Canada, Sweden, Italy, and the US according to a spreadsheet maintained by Global.health. According to a 19 May report by the the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, many of these cases are likely the result of community transmission since many do not appear to be linked to travel: > Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities, is considered to be high. The likelihood of transmission between individuals without close contact is considered to be low.  Monkeypox is closely related to but distinct from smallpox. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980. The first case of monkeypox was diagnosed in 1970 and in recent years the frequency and geographic distribution has increased in Central Africa and West Africa.  A recent systematic review finds that monkeypox has a less severe clinical presentation and is less transmissible than smallpox, but also that it has been evolving in recent decades to become of \"global relevance.\" The same article also reports a pooled case fatality rate estimate of 8.7%, with a point estimate of 10.6% for the Central African clade and 3.6% for the West African clade. As of 18 May, all sequenced monkeypox cases seem to be of the West African clade according to the World Health Organization (WHO).   Prior to the ongoing 2022 outbreak, the majority of reported and suspected monkeypox cases were thought to be the result of animal-to-human transmission rather than human-to-human transmission. The secondary attack rate (SAR) estimates of monkeypox pre-2022 are consistent with this \u2014 according to the aforementioned systematic review article, which reviewed 16 articles with SAR estimates: > More than half of the articles (9/16) reported an SAR of 0%, and this spanned the decades from the 1970s through 2010\u20132019. Similarly, over those same five decades, the SAR ranged from 0.3\u201310.2% in 6/16 articles . In the remaining article, a median SAR of 50% was reported in an outbreak among 16 households.  However,  monkeypox now seems to be spreading as a result of close contact between humans, perhaps in particular during sexual activities.  ---------------  As of 12PM EST on May 19, of the 75 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases that have been reported outside of sub-Saharan Africa, 57 (76%) are in European countries.    The purpose of this question is to determine the extent to which, in the near term, community transmission of monkeypox will be sustained in Europe.",

    "question": "What will be the total number of confirmed and suspected monkeypox cases in Canada as of July 1, 2022?",
    "context": "Dozens of reported cases of monkeypox have been reported outside of areas in sub-Saharan Africa (namely, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo) in which it is endemic. As of 12PM EST on 19 May, there are 75 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases across the UK, Portugal, Spain, Canada, Sweden, Italy, and the US according to a spreadsheet maintained by Global.health. According to a 19 May report by the the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, many of these cases are likely the result of community transmission since many do not appear to be linked to travel: > Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities, is considered to be high. The likelihood of transmission between individuals without close contact is considered to be low.  Monkeypox is closely related to but distinct from smallpox. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980. The first case of monkeypox was diagnosed in 1970 and in recent years the frequency and geographic distribution has increased in Central Africa and West Africa.  A recent systematic review finds that monkeypox has a less severe clinical presentation and is less transmissible than smallpox, but also that it has been evolving in recent decades to become of \"global relevance.\" The same article also reports a pooled case fatality rate estimate of 8.7%, with a point estimate of 10.6% for the Central African clade and 3.6% for the West African clade. As of 18 May, all sequenced monkeypox cases seem to be of the West African clade according to the World Health Organization (WHO).   Prior to the ongoing 2022 outbreak, the majority of reported and suspected monkeypox cases were thought to be the result of animal-to-human transmission rather than human-to-human transmission. The secondary attack rate (SAR) estimates of monkeypox pre-2022 are consistent with this \u2014 according to the aforementioned systematic review article, which reviewed 16 articles with SAR estimates: > More than half of the articles (9/16) reported an SAR of 0%, and this spanned the decades from the 1970s through 2010\u20132019. Similarly, over those same five decades, the SAR ranged from 0.3\u201310.2% in 6/16 articles . In the remaining article, a median SAR of 50% was reported in an outbreak among 16 households.  However,  monkeypox now seems to be spreading as a result of close contact between humans, perhaps in particular during sexual activities.  ---------------  As of 4PM EST on May 20, there have been 22 reported monkeypox cases in Canada.  The purpose of this question is to determine the extent to which, in the near term, community transmission of monkeypox will be observed in the Canada.",

You can view all other questions in this round here.   ----- Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but AI now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond.   However, measured productivity growth has actually declined by half over the past decade [2]. To some extent, this may be evidence that information technology and other conventional stuff (non-informational inputs or outputs) aren't actually so cheaply or widely substitutable [3].  The prospects of growth of tech and automation may also be constrained by Baumol\u2019s \u201ccost disease\u201d: sectors with rapid productivity growth are able to charge lower prices and subsequently have their share of GDP decline, whilst those with relatively slow productivity growth experience increases in their share of the value contributed to the economy. This might effectively cap the rate of growth of the value of tech as a proportion of the total economy [4].  Brynjolfsson et al. [5] have argued that recent progress in AI and automation might well be radically productivity enhancing, but this might yet go largely unnoticed because of an implementation lag: it takes considerable time to be able to sufficiently harness technologies with broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose technologies.

    "context": "Electric vehicles are notoriously expensive, a reason that often pushes the average consumer to buy combustion engine automobiles or the cheaper hybrid options. A major reason for the high pricing points of EVs are the lithium-ion batteries which fuel them. 51% of the cost of an electric vehicle resides in its powertrain, which includes the car\u2019s battery, controllers, inverters, and transmission equipment.   With new announcements from Tesla\u2019s battery day, and a publicized shift to the use and production of lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFPs) and high nickel batteries, electric vehicles are predicted to see their production costs fall, thereby bringing down the overall market price.  Low prices could dramatically impact consumer adoption and increase EV production, which could help change the tide of carbon emissions in protecting the environment. Just in the United States, if everyone drove an electric vehicle, carbon emissions would drop around 8.4%.   It is possible to ascertain both producer dynamics in the market and competition levels, as well as consumer preferences with regards to EV criteria by looking at sales differences between models on the market.

    "question": "If the total estimated number of novel coronavirus cases before 2021 exceeds 100 million, how many people will die before January 1, 2021?",
    "context": "As of February 21, 2020, the Metaculus community expects that, in the median case, the novel coronavirus will cause fewer deaths than seasonal influenza. However, what is so concerning about this new disease is its tail risk: it has a small but non-negligible probability of being extraordinarily bad.For various reasons, the standard Metaculus question about the number of deaths is too crude an estimate to get a good sense of the tail risk posed by this virus. There are too few predictions at the extreme ends, so the values tend to fluctuate based on few data points. Moreover, the slider UI has some limitations that make it hard to be precise about low-probability assignments.Accordingly, it makes sense to ask a specific question about tail risk. That is the goal of this question. The conditional structure requires predictors to focus purely on the scenario where COVID-19 infects 100M people or more.At the time of writing, the community only assigns ~25% probability to the proposition that the estimated case count will exceed 66 million before 2021.Resolution critera: If the question about the number of estimated cases resolves with a value greater than or equal to 100 million, this question resolves with the same value as the question about death count. Otherwise, this question resolves ambiguously.",

You can view all other questions in this round here.   -----  Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but AI now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond.   However, measured productivity growth has actually declined by half over the past decade [2]. To some extent, this may be evidence that information technology and other conventional stuff (non-informational inputs or outputs) aren't actually so cheaply or widely substitutable [3].  The prospects of growth of tech and automation may also be constrained by Baumol\u2019s \u201ccost disease\u201d: sectors with rapid productivity growth are able to charge lower prices and subsequently have their share of GDP decline, whilst those with relatively slow productivity growth experience increases in their share of the value contributed to the economy. This might effectively cap the rate of growth of the value of tech as a proportion of the total economy [4].  Brynjolfsson et al.[5] have argued that recent progress in AI and automation might well be radically productivity enhancing, but this might yet go largely unnoticed because of an implementation lag: it takes considerable time to be able to sufficiently harness technologies with broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose technologies.

    "context": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.  Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.  Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.  Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.  It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.",

    "question": "How many DC charging stations will Boulder, CO have by the end 2021?",
    "context": "#Background  As new electric vehicle models enter the market with increasing ranges and falling prices, consumer interest is rising. We are tracking this consumer interest and general electric vehicle adoption through the number of charging stations available in the top ten states after California. We\u2019ve selected cities in these states outside of the core areas of EV infrastructure and development, usually the largest metropolitan places, to observe general trends throughout the rest of the state.     Boulder County, CO hosts the second largest number of public charging locations (153) in the state of Colorado. 90 of those chargers reside in Boulder, the largest city in Boulder County. However, according to ChargePoint\u2019s map of charging locations across the United States, none those locations have the option for DC Fast charging.   DC Fast charging, also known as level three charging, can provide up to 480 V of energy directly into the battery of an electric vehicle, significantly reducing charging time. Most electric vehicles can recharge 80% of their battery power in just under an hour using DC fast chargers. This makes them the perfect choice for charging infrastructure across public and private short term parking lots. AC, or level 2, charging requires the car to convert the energy into a direct current for the battery and can take 4 to 12 hours to charge the battery fully. This is currently the most predominant charging technology across America.   However, many people running errands rarely stay parked in the same place for enough time to warrant plugging their vehicle into the level 2 chargers provided in some parking lots. DC chargers make up only 15% of the current charging infrastructure across the country, and could provide more accessible charging capabilities for electric vehicle drivers if properly developed.   Currently, Boulder boasts a fleet of 5,342 electric vehicles, including battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles, within the city limits. With large public spaces like malls, hospitals, and universities, there exist many opportunities for charging infrastructure development. Main attractions in Boulder include Boulder Municipal Airport, Village Boulder Shopping Center, and the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Colorado offers a variety of incentive programs to help fuel consumer demand. However, subsidies are expected to fall by $2,000 in 2021 and another $700 by 2023 as demand increases and adoption rates rise. Colorado recently passed legislation allowing consumers to buy directly from EV producers, bypassing the need for an official, established auto dealership, which should also increase access and availability of these vehicles for consumers.",

In February of 2020, President Trump announced a new plan which would cut the education budgets by 8%. He also supported plans to cut standardized loans for students enrolling in higher education.   With resources already stretched thin during the economic crisis brought by COVID-19 in 2020, higher education institutions are forced to continue furloughing employees due to decreased governmental support and student tuition payments. Teachers and staff in secondary schools across the country are also being asked to take pay cuts and furloughed days.   Going forward, with new political leaders in federal and state governments, and a COVID-19 vaccine on the way, we should hopefully see budgets increase and teachers and staff returning to their positions in 2021.

    "context": "On January 3, 2022, Paul Christiano, of the Alignment Research Center (ARC), posted on LessWrong offering prizes for proposals about eliciting latent knowledge (ELK).  The post describes eliciting latent knowledge (ELK) and the proposals being sought as follows:  >Roughly speaking, the goal of ELK is to incentivize ML models to honestly answer \u201cstraightforward\u201d questions where the right answer is unambiguous and known by the model.  > >ELK is currently unsolved in the worst case\u2014for every training strategy we\u2019ve thought of so far, we can describe a case where an ML model trained with that strategy would give unambiguously bad answers to straightforward questions despite knowing better. Situations like this may or may not come up in practice, but nonetheless we are interested in finding a strategy for ELK for which we can\u2019t think of any counterexample.  ELK and the existing counterexamples are described in more detail in ARC's December 2021 report _Eliciting latent knowledge: How to tell if your eyes deceive you_.  Here is how the post describes prize awards:  >To win a prize, you need to specify a training strategy for ELK that handles all of the counterexamples that we\u2019ve described so far, summarized in the section below\u2014i.e. where the breaker would need to specify something new about the test case to cause the strategy to break down. You don\u2019t need to fully solve the problem in the worst case to win a prize, you just need to come up with a strategy that requires a new counterexample. > >We\u2019ll give a $5,000 prize to any proposal that we think clears this bar. We\u2019ll give a $50,000 prize to a proposal which we haven\u2019t considered and seems sufficiently promising to us or requires a new idea to break. We\u2019ll give intermediate prizes for ideas that we think are promising but we\u2019ve already considered, as well as for proposals that come with novel counterexamples, clarify some other aspect of the problem, or are interesting in other ways. A major purpose of the contest is to provide support for people understanding the problem well enough to start contributing; we aren\u2019t trying to only reward ideas that are new to us.  Some retroactive prizes have already been awarded as described below:  >We\u2019re giving prizes to existing proposals from David Dalrymple ($5k), Ramana Kumar ($3k), John Maxwell ($2k), and Yonadav Shavit ($1k).",

You can view all other questions in this round here.   ----  Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but AI now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond.   However, measured productivity growth has actually declined by half over the past decade [2]. To some extent, this may be evidence that information technology and other conventional stuff (non-informational inputs or outputs) aren't actually so cheaply or widely substitutable [3].  The prospects of growth of tech and automation may also be constrained by Baumol\u2019s \u201ccost disease\u201d: sectors with rapid productivity growth are able to charge lower prices and subsequently have their share of GDP decline, whilst those with relatively slow productivity growth experience increases in their share of the value contributed to the economy. This might effectively cap the rate of growth of the value of tech as a proportion of the total economy [4].  Brynjolfsson et al.[5] have argued that recent progress in AI and automation might well be radically productivity enhancing, but this might yet go largely unnoticed because of an implementation lag: it takes considerable time to be able to sufficiently harness technologies with broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose technologies.

On 1 September 2021, the country had reported a cumulative death toll of 1019.  With the latest Delta wave triggering widespread lockdowns, however, the State and Federal governments have switched from an 'elimination' strategy to a 'containment' strategy.  Based principally on modelling from the Doherty Institute, the Australian government now supports 'reopening' when 70-80% vaccination targets are reached in the 16+ population. This modelling suggests that  > Almost 400,000 symptomatic cases could be seen in six months, and between 1,000-2,000 deaths. (ABC)  However, the simplifying assumptions of the Doherty Institute modelling have received criticism. In one recent report from the Australia Institute, the authors write:  > Perhaps most significantly, the Doherty modelling results are based on the assumption that the effectiveness of the Testing Tracing Isolation and Quarantine (TTIQ) system never deteriorates below the level experienced during Melbourne\u2019s second wave infections that saw daily cases top 700 per day.  > [...] > Given that NSW case numbers have already topped 1,000 per day and that the last time the NSW government publicly announced data on unlinked cases more than 800 of their daily cases were unlinked it would seem optimistic in the extreme for Scott Morrison to continue to base his national plan on the assumption made by Doherty, back in June 2021, that the effectiveness of TTIQ would not fall below that experienced during Melbourne\u2019s second wave.",

You can view all other questions in this round here.   ----  Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but AI now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond.   However, measured productivity growth has actually declined by half over the past decade [2]. To some extent, this may be evidence that information technology and other conventional stuff (non-informational inputs or outputs) aren't actually so cheaply or widely substitutable [3].  The prospects of growth of tech and automation may also be constrained by Baumol\u2019s \u201ccost disease\u201d: sectors with rapid productivity growth are able to charge lower prices and subsequently have their share of GDP decline, whilst those with relatively slow productivity growth experience increases in their share of the value contributed to the economy. This might effectively cap the rate of growth of the value of tech as a proportion of the total economy [4].  Brynjolfsson et al. [5] have argued that recent progress in AI and automation might well be radically productivity enhancing, but this might yet go largely unnoticed because of an implementation lag: it takes considerable time to be able to sufficiently harness technologies with broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose technologies.

Moreover, we now have an improved familiarity with the policy of quantitative easing (QE), the purchase of securities with newly created central-bank reserves aimed at lowering interest and stimulating expenditure.However, with low policy rates, there is little room for monetary policy to manoeuvre in a recession without considerable creativity. Moreover, the fiscal policy outlook might be worrisome as well. Congress may have less room than it did during the Great Recession, with the country\u2019s debt burden as a share of the overall economic output rising from 63 percent to 105 percent, and the US deficit to GDP now being 4.0%, compared to 1.1% in 2007.If the US goes into a recession before 2032, how many months will the economic contraction (from peak to trough) last?A recession is here taken to be a two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP.

Thanks to the Australian Government's Public Sector Workplace Relations Policy, the relationship between public and private sector WPI is also legally important: for a large portion of government employees, annual adjustments to remuneration are capped in line with the private sector WPI change.

Holicity\u2019s CEO commented on the merger announcement that \u201cAstra\u2019s space platform will further improve our communications, help us protect our planet, and unleash entrepreneurs to launch a new generation of services to enhance our lives.\u201d   Founded in 2016, the company aims to expand the realm of space innovation and exploration in the low Earth orbit through frequent launches of their newly designed and tested rockets. Their goals, however, depend heavily upon their ability to economize and scale the production of rockets - something the company has planned for by welcoming Benjamin Lyons to the team. Lyons, who spent more than two decades at Apple and spearheaded projects ranging from the development of the iPhone to Apple\u2019s autonomously driving cars, plans to take Astra from the \u201ciPhone 1\u201d to the \u201ciPhone X\u201d over the next several years as the company grows.  Once public, Astra will strive to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet through both rockets and eventually satellites.

Solar pv generated around 2% of total energy in the U.S. in 2017. In Germany, an estimated 7% of net generated electricity was solar-generated in 2017.Solar energy production is cleaner than most non-renewable energy production. For example, according to the IPCC, the life cycle CO2 equivalent of energy production by rooftop solar cells is 41 co2 equivalent per kWh, which is less than 1/10 of that from the energy production by gas.According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), in 2018, the weighted-average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar PV was USD 0.085/kWh (IRENA, 2019). This was 13% lower than for projects commissioned in 2017 (ibid.).What will the global weighted-average levelized cost of energy of utility-scale solar PV be in 2020, in 2018 USD per kWh?ResolutionThis question resolves as the global weighted-average LCOE of utility-scale solar PV be in 2020, in 2018 USD per kWh, per IRENA estimates. Prices are to be converted to 2018 USD using BLS CPI for all urban consumers and all items. In case IRENA data is not available, other sources of estimates of the global weighted-average LCOE of solar PV may be consulted. These other sources should be deemed by an admin to be sufficiently similar in methodology. One criterion of similarity is that the estimate of the 2018 LCOE solar PV is not more than 25% different from $0.085/kWh in 2018 USD.",

On the one hand, there has been continued progress in vaccine uptake and vaccines are very effective in preventing cases from progressing into hospitalizations. On the other hand, there is some01358-1/fulltext) evidence that the delta variant causes more severe disease \u2014 potentially leading to more hospitalizations, particularly among unvaccinated people.   The case-to-hospitalization rate here is calculated by dividing the total number of cases that are reported over a 7-day period from the total number of hospitalizations that are reported over a 7-day period eight days later. For example: the total number of new confirmed+probable COVID-19 cases between 1 June and 7 June (inclusive) was 1,449, and the total number of new confirmed+probable hospitalizations reported eight days later between 9 June and 15 June was 65. This gives a case-to-hospitalization rate of ~4.5% (65/1449 * 100).",

Patterns in consumer spending inform total consumer demand, which has great influence on the stock and bond markets. Should retail sales fall, it would indicate a drop in demand, foretelling potential economic contraction. Consumers generally buy more when they feel confident in the economy and its future.  Total retail sales are generally divided into different sections, usually by durability. These include: apparel, department stores, food and beverage stores, electronics and appliances, furniture stores, gas stations, and car dealers  Understanding the movements in consumer demand across these different industries can help investors know when, where, and how to invest across the stock market, and provide clues to the Federal Reserve and other parties on the future movements of the economy.

    "context": "The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.  Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable.

This helps to track consumer demand for durable and non-durable goods over a specified time frame. The retail sales data is compiled monthly by the US Census Bureau, and is also reported through the many other economic calendars.  Patterns in consumer spending inform total consumer demand, which has great influence on the stock and bond markets. Should retail sales fall, it would indicate a drop in demand, foretelling potential economic contraction. Consumers generally buy more when they feel confident in the economy and its future.  Total retail sales are generally divided into different sections, usually by durability. These include: apparel, department stores, food and beverage stores, electronics and appliances, furniture stores, gas stations, and car dealers  Understanding the movements in consumer demand across these different industries can help investors know when, where, and how to invest across the stock market, and provide clues to the Federal Reserve and other parties on the future movements of the economy.

These are by no means new, but part of the governmental process. Some of these tools of power are basically cultural windowdressing, while others can have fairly wide-ranging consequences.Chief among those are Executive Orders.These can be relatively small, but FDR was the first\u2014and most prolific\u2014user of the keener edge of this sharp-toothed tool. He issued the most orders bar none, with the runner up (Wilson) parely managing half his numbers. Even relative to the duration of their presidency FDR leads, though not by as big a margin.President Trump repeatedly expressed his frustration with the other branches of the government, claiming involvement of a \u2018Deep State\u2019 as a counter to his presidency.

    "context": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.  Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.  Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.  Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.  It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.",

Users pay fees so that nodes will include their transactions in the chain. The fee attached to an Ethereum transaction is usually called \"gas\".  Currently, the price of gas is determined via auction. When users submit transactions to the blockchain they indicate how much they're willing to pay for their transaction to be included in the next block. Nodes then sort transactions selfishly to maximize their profit. This leads to fee volatility and results in long delays for transactions submitted with low bids, among other issues.  Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 seeks to address this by introducing new pricing mechanism. With EIP-1559, a base fee is calculated dynamically as a function of network congestion. Crucially, this base fee is \"burned\" i.e. forever removed from the ETH supply. On top of this base fee, users can add a priority fee that works similarly to current fees.  The effect this will have on gas price remains unclear, with Ethereum core developers opining that it will have no overall impact.

Founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, the fintech company is dedicated to offering commission free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds via an online app network.   The public outrage felt by amateur investors as Robinhood suspended trading on Gamestop sparked an investigation into Robinhood and their relationship to Wall Street Hedge Funds like Citadel Securities this February which culminated in an initial hearing before the US Congress on February 18th. Lines of attack from both Republican and Democratic members of the House hearing committee included suspicions that the firm had failed to properly manage its own capital risks, and the problematic gamification of the app that lawmakers argued led to the suicide of one amateur investor who could not re-trade their GameStock stock after amassing a supposed 700k in debt.   The committee chair of the hearing, Maxine Walters, says that this is only the beginning of the investigation into Wall Street and the payment for order flow business model. She plans to bring in the SEC to enforce stronger protections for investors and the oversight of financial plumbing in further hearings.   Despite the controversy over its role, Robinhood shares jumped 50% in January, and the most recent valuation of its shares placed the total valuation for the firm at $40 billion, more than double its valuation via private funding rounds in September 2020. In the last week of January, there were more than 1 million new downloads of the Robinhood app, showing that amateur investors are still bullish on the prospects of the company.

Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.  Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable.

It the the global-mean surface temperature change associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration over its preindustrial value (Vial et al. 2013). The standard metric for climate sensitivity is the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) given as the change in temperature at equilibrium for a doubling of CO2, neglecting long-term feedbacks associated with vegetation changes, carbon feedbacks and ice sheet dynamics (Skeie et al. 2017).The first attempt to calculate climate sensitivity was in 1896, by the Swedish scientist, Svante Arrhenius. He found that CO2 doubling should increase the Earth's mean temperature by 5\u20136\u00b0C (Lapenis, 2006). Since then, hundreds of estimates have been made based on climate modelling and/or estimates based on physical evidence, such as climate changes in the distant past (Knutti et al., 2017).Some have argued that from the 1980s onward, the uncertainty in climate projections has not narrowed appreciably, despite tremendous increases in computing power, in observations, and in the number of scientists studying the problem. For instance, In 2013, the IPCC widened the range of its estimate of climate sensitivity once again, opting for the \"likely\" range of 1.5\u00b0C to 4.5\u00b0C (66% confidence interval) (Freeman et al., 2015). The resolution of this dilemma has important implications for climate research and policy.The \u2018likely\u2019 range (i.e. its 66% confidence interval) of ECS as stated in the IPCC's 5th annual report (IPCC, 2014) is 1.5\u20134.5 degrees Celsius. This is the range same that was givien in the IPCC's first report (IPCC, 1990). The IPCC's sixth report is currently scheduled for publication in 2022.A 2018 article aims to revise the estimate of climate sensitivity, and reduces the range of possible end-of-century outcomes by more than half. It finds a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits (equivalent to the IPCC \u2018likely\u2019 range) of 2.2\u20133.4 degrees Celsius.Although seemingly beneficial, a reduction in the lower limit of the IPCC's lower limit in the range could be bad news. (Freeman et al.) argue that a lowering of the bottom of the range, although this reduces the mean of the estimate, our estimate of its standard deviation may increase. In turn, deeper uncertainty should magnify concerns, since marginal damages from rising temperatures increase rapidly.What will the lower limit in the IPCC's \u2018likely\u2019 range of its climate sensitivity estimate be, in its sixth Assessment Report?ResolutionThis question resolves as the lower of the 66% confidence limits, i.e. the lower number of its 'likely' range, of the IPCC's estimate for climate sensitivity in its sixth Assessment Report. The question resolves ambiguous if the sixth Assessment Report is not published before the end of 2024, or if it does not issue the estimate in the report.In case of format changes to the IPCC's representation of their estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity (i.e. different confidence interval is presented), an admin shall examine the relevant technical publication(s) produced by the IPCC, or those that principally inform the IPCC estimates for climate sensitivity, to work out the associated 66% confidence interval from their cumulative probability function (CDF). In case different confidence intervals are provided and the relevant CDF is not disclosed, we shall assume that the CDF is equivalent to the analytic form found in Roe and Baker (2007), so that the 66% confidence interval can be worked out.",

Predominantly helpful for retailers, economists, and investors, data for this indicator is collected through telephone surveys every month to a random cross section of US consumers across the country. Consisting of 60% new recipients, and 40% repeat recipients from previous surveys, the survey attempts to accurately measure and portray shifts in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy.  > \u201cRespondents are polled to express their opinion on the following questions: Whether their families' financial conditions have become better or worse than a year ago; Whether respondents expect their families' financial conditions to become better or worse a year from now; Whether business conditions in the next 12 months will become better or worse; How conditions in the country may change in the next five years - whether respondents expect stability or growth of unemployment or depression; Whether it is a good time to purchase large household items and make other large purchases (such as to buy a house, a car, etc.). Answers to these questions are calculated as follows: the percentage of negative values is subtracted from positive ones, and 100 is added to the resulting value.

    "context": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.  Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.  Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.  Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.  It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.",

    "question": "What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in June 2021?",
    "context": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.  Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.  Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.  Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.  It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.",

    "context": "The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is a key economic indicator that helps predict the future movements in the economy by illustrating the average US consumer\u2019s confidence level. Predominantly helpful for retailers, economists, and investors, data for this indicator is collected through telephone surveys every month to a random cross section of US consumers across the country. Consisting of 60% new recipients, and 40% repeat recipients from previous surveys, the survey attempts to accurately measure and portray shifts in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy.  > \u201cRespondents are polled to express their opinion on the following questions: Whether their families' financial conditions have become better or worse than a year ago; Whether respondents expect their families' financial conditions to become better or worse a year from now; Whether business conditions in the next 12 months will become better or worse; How conditions in the country may change in the next five years - whether respondents expect stability or growth of unemployment or depression; Whether it is a good time to purchase large household items and make other large purchases (such as to buy a house, a car, etc.). Answers to these questions are calculated as follows: the percentage of negative values is subtracted from positive ones, and 100 is added to the resulting value. The resulting values \u200b\u200bare added up and divided by 6.7558 (the benchmark value), after which 2 (the correction constant for the sample composition) is added to the resulting figure.\u201d  Consumers who feel more confident about the future of the economy are more likely to increase their demand and purchasing habits, and pull money out of savings.

Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.  Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable.

    "question": "What will be the total stock of crude oil and other petroleum products for May 2021?",
    "context": "Context =======  The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.  Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.  Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.  Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.  It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.

    "question": "What percentage of Americans will be able to cover an unexpected $400 expense without selling something or borrowing money in 2020?",
    "context": "Since 2013, the Federal Reserve Board has conducted the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which measures the economic well-being of U.S. households and identifies potential risks to their finances. The survey includes modules on a range of topics of current relevance to financial well-being including credit access and behaviors, savings, retirement, economic fragility, and education and student loans.Since its first edition in 2013, the SHED has included a question about whether or not the survey participant could cover an unexpected $400 expense without needing to sell something or borrow money.In 2013, only 50% of survey participants said that they could do so. (See Figure 11 in the link above.) That number has slowly but steadily improved over time. In 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available as of January 16 2019, 59% of survey participants said they could do so.This question asks: In the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking conducted for the year 2020, what percentage of Americans will say that they could cover an unexpected $400 expense without needing to sell something or borrow money?In the event that this survey is renamed or discontinued but the same question is asked by another survey conducted by either the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Treasury, this question should remain active.

    "context": "Context =======  The Federal Reserve keeps an Industrial Production Index which measures and records the monthly real output of all industrial facilities within the United States including manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas utilities, and is seasonally adjusted.  The industrial sector, along with construction, accounts for most of the variation in national output over the business cycle. Large drops in industrial production from a drop in supply or consumer demand would indicate a change in economic growth, and potentially signal the beginning of a period of economic contraction. Likewise, a large boom in production and demand would indicate economic expansion, and boost investor confidence in those industries. Understanding economic fluctuations and health is imperative for investors and companies alike involved in the stock market.  Another important metric which often accompanies the Industrial Production Index is the Capacity Utilization Rate. This rate provides an estimate of how much factory capacity is in use.

A higher number should be read negatively as higher unemployment reduces the productivity of the economy.  Greatly impacted by the spread of COVID-19, the number of initial jobless claims skyrocketed in March but has gradually begun to decrease since then. However, the current level for the beginning of August is over five times the level recorded in December of 2019.

    "context": "#Background  The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is a key economic indicator that helps predict the future movements in the economy by illustrating the average US consumer\u2019s confidence level. Predominantly helpful for retailers, economists, and investors, data for this indicator is collected through telephone surveys every month to a random cross section of US consumers across the country. Consisting of 60% new recipients, and 40% repeat recipients from previous surveys, the survey attempts to accurately measure and portray shifts in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy.   > \u201cRespondents are polled to express their opinion on the following questions: Whether their families' financial conditions have become better or worse than a year ago; Whether respondents expect their families' financial conditions to become better or worse a year from now; Whether business conditions in the next 12 months will become better or worse; How conditions in the country may change in the next five years - whether respondents expect stability or growth of unemployment or depression; Whether it is a good time to purchase large household items and make other large purchases (such as to buy a house, a car, etc.). Answers to these questions are calculated as follows: the percentage of negative values is subtracted from positive ones, and 100 is added to the resulting value. The resulting values \u200b\u200bare added up and divided by 6.7558 (the benchmark value), after which 2 (the correction constant for the sample composition) is added to the resulting figure.\u201d  Consumers who feel more confident about the future of the economy are more likely to increase their demand and purchasing habits, and pull money out of savings. However, the opposite is true when consumers feel less confident. When more money flows through the economy, there is less worry for recession, and the index value increases.

    "context": "Context =======  The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.  Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable.

Should retail sales fall, it would indicate a drop in demand, foretelling potential economic contraction. Consumers generally buy more when they feel confident in the economy and its future.  Total retail sales are generally divided into different sections, usually by durability. These include: apparel, department stores, food and beverage stores, electronics and appliances, furniture stores, gas stations, and car dealers  Understanding the movements in consumer demand across these different industries can help investors know when, where, and how to invest across the stock market, and provide clues to the Federal Reserve and other parties on the future movements of the economy.

    "question": "What will be the total stock of crude oil and other petroleum products for April 2021?",
    "context": "Context =======  The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.  Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.  Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.  Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.  It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.

    "question": "What will be the Industrial Production Index number for March 2021?",
    "context": "Context =======  The Federal Reserve keeps an Industrial Production Index which measures and records the monthly real output of all industrial facilities within the United States including manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas utilities, and is seasonally adjusted.  The industrial sector, along with construction, accounts for most of the variation in national output over the business cycle. Large drops in industrial production from a drop in supply or consumer demand would indicate a change in economic growth, and potentially signal the beginning of a period of economic contraction. Likewise, a large boom in production and demand would indicate economic expansion, and boost investor confidence in those industries. Understanding economic fluctuations and health is imperative for investors and companies alike involved in the stock market.  Another important metric which often accompanies the Industrial Production Index is the Capacity Utilization Rate. This rate provides an estimate of how much factory capacity is in use.

    "context": "Three distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have been detected and are now the subject of intense study: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. B.1.1.7 is thought to have emerged in the UK in November 2020 and is likely significantly more transmissible than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. B.1.351 was first detected in South Africa in October 2020 and seems to have an ability to escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by previous infection and reduce the efficacy of vaccines in development. P.1 was first detected in Brazil in January 2020 and, like B.1.351, seems like it is able to escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by previous infection00183-5/fulltext). All three of these variants have a S:N501 mutation that differentiates them from other variants.  There is substantial concern that additional variants that are more transmissible and/or can evade preexisting immunity will arise.

    "context": "#Background  The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is a key economic indicator that helps predict the future movements in the economy by illustrating the average US consumer\u2019s confidence level. Predominantly helpful for retailers, economists, and investors, data for this indicator is collected through telephone surveys every month to a random cross section of US consumers across the country. Consisting of 60% new recipients, and 40% repeat recipients from previous surveys, the survey attempts to accurately measure and portray shifts in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy.   > \u201cRespondents are polled to express their opinion on the following questions: Whether their families' financial conditions have become better or worse than a year ago; Whether respondents expect their families' financial conditions to become better or worse a year from now; Whether business conditions in the next 12 months will become better or worse; How conditions in the country may change in the next five years - whether respondents expect stability or growth of unemployment or depression; Whether it is a good time to purchase large household items and make other large purchases (such as to buy a house, a car, etc.). Answers to these questions are calculated as follows: the percentage of negative values is subtracted from positive ones, and 100 is added to the resulting value. The resulting values \u200b\u200bare added up and divided by 6.7558 (the benchmark value), after which 2 (the correction constant for the sample composition) is added to the resulting figure.\u201d  Consumers who feel more confident about the future of the economy are more likely to increase their demand and purchasing habits, and pull money out of savings. However, the opposite is true when consumers feel less confident. When more money flows through the economy, there is less worry for recession, and the index value increases.",

    "context": "SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, otherwise known as Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC), is a novel SARS-CoV-2 strain that originated in the United Kingdom in late summer/early fall 2020. A recent pre-print estimates B.1.1.7 to be 56% more transmissible (95% Crl: 50%-74%) compared to preexisting variants. A second pre-print finds that the new variant has \u201can additive increase in R that ranged between 0.4 and 0.7, and alternatively as a multiplicative increase in R that ranged between 50% and 75%.\"   The B.1.1.7 strain is characterized by 17 new mutations. One of these mutations, S.H69- (a deletion of H69),  can be detected via PCR diagnostic testing. If the PCR test shows an S gene dropout, where the S probe of the RT-PCR test cannot bind to the S gene due to B.1.1.7's H69 deletion, then the sample has the potential to be the B.1.1.7 strain \u2014 at that point, further sequencing would be needed to determine if a second mutation is present: the N501Y (S:N501Y) mutation.   In the UK, B.1.1.7 is so widespread that a PCR test that shows S-gene dropout alone is a strong indicator the sample is the B.1.1.7 variant \u2014 recent data indicates ~98% of S gene dropout samples in the UK are B.1.1.7. To date, B.1.1.7 is not widespread enough in the United States to consider a sample with a S gene dropout synonymous with the B.1.1.7 variant.    As of 2020-01-04, the genomic repository and analysis platform NextStrain, which uses viral samples submitted to GISAID, reported 381 samples with an S-gene dropout (S.H69-) have been sequenced and uploaded in the United States. Among samples with an S-gene dropout in the U.S., 1.84% (7/381) percent were identified as B.1.1.7 in a NextStrain/GISAID database maintained by the Neher Lab. Please note that there is a lag between sequence collection and sequence upload \u2014 so the number of sequences to date will be backfilled once those sequences are uploaded.

    "context": "#Background  Founded in 2004 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel and released to the public in 2006, Roblox is expected to enter the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) sometime this February 2021. Market Realist estimates that with private funding for a direct listing at $45 dollars a share, the company could reach a valuation of almost $30 billion dollars.   Roblox, an online gaming and game creation system platform, allows users to both develop and program their own games as well as play games created by other users. With a collected revenue of $589 million in the first nine months of 2020 and a 68% increase in revenue over the same period from 2019, Roblox is experiencing massive growth. During this time, order bookings, which account for the main bulk of Robux (an in-game currency) purchases, grew 171% to a total of $1.24 billion. As user engagement grows, the value of Roblox stock as a growth stock increases as well, making it an interesting choice to speculate on its initial asking price by the end of its first day of trading.   Other online gaming companies like Zynga and King Digital Entertainment, the creator of Candy Crush, encountered massive failures after the release of their IPOs. While Roblox is confident in their ability to avoid a similar fate by allowing their users to create and play new games, the company continues to experience a low life span for the average paying customer at 23 months. As Roblox generates the majority of its revenue from Robux sales to users, and does not require a standardized subscription payment, a short lifespan could cause worry amongst investors.  Predictions should reflect the end of day asking price for the RBLX stock on the NYSE on the day of its public direct listing. According to the NYSE, there are no current listings for expected pricing of the stock, however that information is expected to be released sometime in the near future.",

The industrial sector, along with construction, accounts for most of the variation in national output over the business cycle. Large drops in industrial production from a drop in supply or consumer demand would indicate a change in economic growth, and potentially signal the beginning of a period of economic contraction. Likewise, a large boom in production and demand would indicate economic expansion, and boost investor confidence in those industries.

As of September 2018, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement, and 181 have become party to it.Some key elements of the Paris Agreement are the following:On June 1, 2017, United States President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease all participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation. Trump stated that \"The Paris Agreement will undermine (the U.S.) economy,\" and \"puts (the U.S.) at a permanent disadvantage.\" Trump stated that the withdrawal would be in accordance with his America First policy.The effects of the US' withdrawal are unclear. In a commentary for Nature, Luke Kemp wrote that \"withdrawal is unlikely to change US emissions\" since \"the greenhouse gas emissions of the US are divorced from international legal obligations.\" However, he added that it could hamper climate change mitigation efforts if the U.S. stops contributing to the Green Climate Fund. Kemp said the effect of a U.S. withdrawal could be either good or bad for the Paris agreement, since \"a rogue US can cause more damage inside rather than outside of the agreement.\" Finally, \"A withdrawal could also make the US into a climate pariah and provide a unique opportunity for China and the EU to take control of the climate regime and significantly boost their international reputations and soft power.\"A previous question, How much global warming by 2100?, asked How much greater (in \u02daC) will the average global temperature in 2100 be than the average global temperature in 1880?. This question asks How much less will the median prediction be to that same question be if the US resumes participation in the Paris Climate Accord?If the US outlined its intention to resume participation in the Paris Climate accord, how much less will the median prediction to How much global warming by 2100? be in the 2-month period following the announcement?An intention is outlined by either (a) the election of a US president with the clear stated position of re-entering the Paris accord, or (b) the announcement by an administration of re-entering it, whichever happens first (if either). The metric used will be a weekly average of the median prediction that will be generated for the 2-month period after the first announced outline. If the US does not announce its intention to resume participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, this question will resolve ambiguously.This question asks how much less global warming if the US resumes participation in the Paris Agreement, so if you expect that the US resuming the Agreement will reduce global warming, you should predict a positive number.",

    "context": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad.Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices.Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today\u2019s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil\u2019s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good.Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices.It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.We thus ask, What will be the total stock of crude oil and other petroleum products for December 2020?Other Related Questions:EIA Petroleum Status Report October 2020EIA Petroleum Status Report November 2020The resolution criteria will be provided from the EIA through their measurements on the weekly stocks of petroleum and other liquids. This metric is recorded as the total stock of crude oil and other petroleum products excluding SPR (strategic petroleum reserve) in thousands of barrels.

Trump's election in 2016 was a surprise to most forecasters, in part due to polling error that showed Hillary Clinton as having a larger level of support than actually materialized in the election. One hypothesized contributor to polling error in the 2020 election is the \"shy Trump voter\" effect, in which Trump voters do not tell others how they intend to vote for fear of political backlash.

Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable.

    "context": "The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable. However, both the full CPI and the core CPI track each other when graphed over the long-run.What will be the seasonally adjusted CPI-U (less energy and food) for October 2020?Resolution criteria will be provided through the Bureau of Labor Statistics through their reports on the CPI. These reports are also posted on Econoday through their economic calendar. If data is not provided monthly by either of these sources, recorded either as M/M % change or the % change from month prior, the question will resolve ambiguously. The data must be seasonally adjusted as well.",

The Industrial portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. Along with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite, it is one of the most influential and scrutinized US equity indices.In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread around the world. By February 28 2020, over 85,000 infections had been confirmed worldwide, along with over 2,900 related deaths.The global spread of the virus spooked financial markets, and led to one of the most rapid selloffs in the history of public equity markets, with major US equity indices experiencing their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis.The Dow closed on February 12 2020 at an all-time high, at 29,551.42 points. By the close of trading on February 28 2020, it had fallen to 25,409.36 points.This question asks: Before the Dow Jones Industrial Average next closes at a record high level, what will be the lowest closing value it reaches?Resolution should cite credible press reports, or information from a financial trading platform or news service.If the Dow Jones Industrial Average is discontinued or modified such that Metaculus administrators believe it is no longer reasonable to continue with this question, this question shall resolve ambiguously.Note that this question refers to the closing value of the Dow, not any intraday level reached.Also see this related question about when the next all-time record high will be reached.",

A higher number should be read negatively as higher unemployment reduces the productivity of the economy.Greatly impacted by the spread of the CoronaVirus, the number of initial jobless claims skyrocketed in March but has gradually begun to decrease since then. However, the current level for the beginning of August is over five times the level recorded in December of 2019.The level of initial jobless claims is an excellent indicator of the health of the jobs market, and the economy as a whole. Low levels of claims can signal that companies might have a more difficult time hiring workers, and that workers currently employed will need overtime pay or higher compensation as an enticement. Wage inflation can increase interest rates and decrease the price of bonds and stocks in the investment market, which is bad news to investors and is watched carefully by the Federal Reserve.Therefore, we ask: What will be the 5-week average of initial jobless claims filed in October?The resolution criteria for this question will be provided through either the Federal Reserve, or through the reports organized on Econoday\u2019s calendar.

    "context": "Initial jobless claims reflect the number of people filing for unemployment insurance over the last week. A higher number should be read negatively as higher unemployment reduces the productivity of the economy.Greatly impacted by the spread of the novel coronavirus, the number of initial jobless claims skyrocketed in March but has gradually begun to decrease since then. However, the current level for the beginning of August is over five times the level recorded in December of 2019.The level of initial jobless claims is an excellent indicator of the health of the jobs market, and the economy as a whole. Low levels of claims can signal that companies might have a more difficult time hiring workers, and that workers currently employed will need overtime pay or higher compensation as an enticement. Wage inflation can increase interest rates and decrease the price of bonds and stocks in the investment market, which is bad news to investors and is watched carefully by the Federal Reserve.Therefore, we ask: How many initial jobless claims will be filed on average (4-week moving average) in September 2020?The resolution criteria for this question will be provided through either the Federal Reserve, or through the reports organized on Econoday\u2019s calendar.

For example, according to the the February 21 report, there are 1200 confirmed cases outside of China/Taiwan, with 175 due to likely exposure in China, 320 due to exposure in the reporting country, and 20 due to exposure outside of both. There are also 685 cases with origin under investigation. So, of cases with known origins, 175 / (1200-685) = 34% are due to exposure in China.On March 27, of all confirmed cases outside of China and Taiwan, what will be the ratio (Due to likely exposure in China) / (Total confirmed - Under investigation)?In earlier versions of the report, the \"Due to likely exposure in China\" column was instead labeled \"Total cases with travel history to China\".

Labour believes that this plan will cost \u00a320bn, though the Conservatives have criticized this, claiming that it is likely to cost \u00a383bn over 10 years and that nationalisation will discourage private investment.The UK's mean download speed is currently 22.37Mbps in 2019, up from 18.57Mbps in 2018; this is in the bottom third of European broadband speeds, due to the slow rollout of full-fiber broadband. Full-fiber broadband itself can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps.If, in the 2019 election, Labour, or a coalition with Labour making up the majority of seats, forms a government, what will be mean broadband speeds in the UK in 2024?Judgement will be by Cable's Worldwide broadband speed league 2024.",

This, however, is rather at odds with cosmological data that puts tight limits on the number of light neutrino species present during nucleosynthesis. The mass the neutrinos would have, of order 1 eV, is too light either to be compatible with these constrains or to serve as dark matter (a theoretical motivation for proposing sterile neutrinos.)It's challenging to work out exactly what experiments are likely to confirm or disconfirm this finding, and when, and how to make a clear question about them. So as a proxy we'll ask:By May 2019 how many citations will the MiniBooNE paper receive?Citations will be taken from Google Scholar applied to the published version of the paper (assuming there is one, and the arxiv version otherwise.)

The freeze was lifted a week later, but as of February 2017, EPA officials have been told to prepare for a flurry of executive orders subsequent to the expected confirmation of Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator.Further worrying signs to the science community: President Trump has pledged to eliminate NASA's earth science division, responsible for earth-facing satellites and climate research. While the president has not yet formally named a science advisor, the leading candidates under consideration are both skeptical of climate change.The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has compiled United States research and development spending, with records in some agencies extending back as far as 1953. Spending varied between $60 and 70 billion over the past ten years, with an overall increase of around 10% over the same time. In FY2017, the nondefense research and development budget was $66.57 billion. Spending levels are shaped by a number of forces, however, with political pressures a possible factor alongside economic conditions and general national priorities.By what percent will nondefense research and development funding change in the FY 2018 budget, as compared to the FY 2017 budget?This question will resolve on October 1, 2017, the first day of FY 2018.

But certain aspects of the experiment indicate particle-like properties as well, suggesting the particle-wave duality that is one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics.A recent experiment adds a new wrinkle to the classic double-slit experiment. Results of a three-slit experiment suggest that photons may follow \"exotic looped trajectories\" in their path from source to target, weaving between the slits in a most un-lightlike way. Unpublished work on arXiv suggests that the researchers also expect to find these looped trajectories in double-slit experiments as well.Although the paper has tens of thousands of page views and nearly 10,000 mentions on Twitter, a more direct measure of the work's acceptance in the scientific community is its number of citations by other papers exploring the same or similar phenomenon.

    "context": "The idea has been steadily gaining currency that after gunpowder and nuclear weapons, the next major revolution in warfare will be driven by artificial intelligence.  Autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons have become a core part of the military strategy of several major powers.  However there is widespread concern that an arms race in autonomous weapons, especially those designed to kill humans, could lead to a pretty bleak future. This has led to a growing movement to seek an international agreement banning or curtailing at lest some types of lethal autonomous weapons.  It was announced at the IJCAI AI and ML meeting that more than 160 organizations and thousands of individuals have pledged *not* to develop lethal autonomous weapons. How successful will this be?",

It will resolve as ambigous if Trump is not impeached by the House in his first term, or leaves office before the end of his term without being impeached, or if he is impeached but no vote is taken by the full Senate.If more than one set of articles of impeachment are referred to the Senate at different times, then only the first set that is referred by the House will be considered for this question.A clarification of what is meant by \"distinct Republican senators\" in the resolution conditions: if a total of two articles of impeachment are voted on, and 5 Republican senators vote yes on Article 1 and no on Article 2, and 10 other Republican senators vote no on Article 1 and yes on Article 2, and those are the only yes votes from Republicans, then the resolution number will be 15, even though no single article received that many Republican yes votes.Note: given the herd-like nature of partisan voting behavior, the new multi-modal prediction capability may come in handy.",

    "context": "#Background  As new electric vehicle models enter the market with increasing ranges and falling prices, consumer interest is rising. We are tracking this consumer interest and general electric vehicle adoption through the number of charging stations available in the top ten states after California. We\u2019ve selected cities in these states outside of the core areas of EV infrastructure and development, usually the largest metropolitan places, to observe general trends throughout the rest of the state.    Orange County, FL hosts the second largest number of public charging locations (200) in the state of Florida, after Miami. Over 75% (165) of those chargers reside in Orlando, the largest city in Orange County. However, according to ChargePoint\u2019s map of charging locations across the United States, none of those locations have the option for DC Fast charging.   DC Fast charging, also known as level three charging, can provide up to 480 V of energy directly into the battery of an electric vehicle, significantly reducing charging time. Most electric vehicles can recharge 80% of their battery power in just under an hour using DC fast chargers. This makes them the perfect choice for charging infrastructure across public and private short term parking lots. AC, or level 2, charging requires the car to convert the energy into a direct current for the battery and can take 4 to 12 hours to charge the battery fully. This is currently the most predominant charging technology across America.   However, many people running errands rarely stay parked in the same place for enough time to warrant plugging their vehicle into the level 2 chargers provided in some parking lots. DC chargers make up only 15% of the current charging infrastructure across the country, and could provide more accessible charging capabilities for electric vehicle drivers if properly developed.   Currently, Orlando boasts a fleet of 5,375 electric vehicles, including battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles, within the city limits. With large public spaces like malls, hospitals, and universities, there exist many opportunities for charging infrastructure development. Main attractions in Orlando include Disney World, and all subsidiary parks and locations, Orlando International Airport, Nemours Children's Hospital and the Orlando VA Hospital, as well as the Orlando Science Center.  The Floridian government announced an $8.6 million investment to strengthen their electric vehicle infrastructure within the state in July 2020 as part of their Electric Vehicle Roadmap plan. They plan to expand charging stations by 50% across the most traveled roads and cities across Florida.",

    "question": "How many wickets will Abrar Ahmed take by the end of the second test match in Multan?",
    "context": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field. The game is played by teams taking turns to bat and bowl. The team batting attempts to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets, while the team bowling attempts to dismiss the batsmen and prevent them from scoring runs. The team that scores the most runs wins the match. Cricket is a popular sport in many countries, especially in the Commonwealth nations.  Test cricket, the longest and most traditional form of the game, can be physically and mentally exhausting for players due to its duration and the need for sustained concentration and effort. Test matches are played over five days, with each team playing two innings. This means that players have to be prepared to play for long periods of time and to maintain their focus and intensity throughout the match.  Abrar Ahmed is a Pakistani cricket bowler. He plays as a leg-spinner, using variations in the speed and trajectory of the ball to deceive the batsman. He made his debut for the Pakistan national team in December 2022, taking seven wickets in the second Test against England. Prior to his international debut, Ahmed was known for his performances in domestic cricket in Pakistan, where he had a successful season in 2022. He was controversially left out of the team for the first Test against England, but was called up for the second Test in Multan. In his debut match, Ahmed took 7-114, the best figures by any spinner on Test debut in 14 years.  In cricket, a wicket is taken when a player is dismissed by the fielding team. This can happen in a few different ways, the most common being bowled, caught, leg before wicket (LBW), run out and stumped. Only some result in the bowler being credited with the dismissal, as we are interested in here.",

For comparison, there were an estimated 3,791,712 births in 2018, according to the official report.One reason why the number of births in 2021 in particular is of interest is the coronavirus crisis. Some commentators have suggested that couples who are forced to spend time at home during quarantine may be more likely to have children, which would increase the birth rate. This however remains to be seen.Resolution criteria: This question will resolve when a US government agency, most likely the National Center for Health Statistics, releases a final estimate of the total number of live births for all US states and territories between January 1 and December 31, 2021. The report will likely not be published until late 2022, which is why this question is expected to resolve by 2023. (E.g. the 2018 report wasn't published until November 2019.)",

    "context": "In 2017, Hurricane Maria delivered a terrible blow to Puerto Rico, leaving nearly the entire island without power. The government estimated that the storm killed only 64 people, but a Harvard study--published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the actual death toll was 70 times higher.Per USA Today:This study made international headlines, for obvious reasons. The researchers' 95% confidence interval stretched between 800 and 8,000 (before adjusting for survivor bias, etc., which increases that count somewhat).Since then, a draft of a report to Congress that requested $139 billion in recovery funds indicated that there were 1427 more deaths in the final four months of 2017 relative to the previous four years. This new figure has been pushed as the \"real\" hurricane death toll, though official statements have undermined this interpretation. H\u00e9ctor Pesquera, the secretary of public safety put it bluntly: \"This is not the official number of deaths attributable to Hurricane Maria.\"What is the true number then? The Government of Puerto Rico commissioned a more rigorous study through George Washington University (GWU) Milken Institute School of Public Health to precisely document the hurricane's toll. So far, researchers have blown a deadline, but they hope to complete the project by summer's end.What will the final number of dead be according to the GWU study?",

If this ballot is passed (a ballot is passed if it gains a simple majority from the voting public), it would mean that no new slaughterhouse could be constructed or operate within city limits.

Over 17 million of Yemen's population are at risk, and over 3.3 million children and pregnant or lactating women suffer from acute malnutrition.According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, the famine in Yemen will soon reach \"biblical proportions\". The famine is being compounded by an outbreak of cholera, which is resulting in 5,000 new cases daily. Devastation of Yemeni infrastructure, health, water and sanitation systems and facilities by Saudi-led coalition air strikes led to the spread of cholera. UNICEF says that Saudi-led coalition airstrikes are deliberately targeting water systems in Yemen.In October 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million people face starvation in what could be \"the worst famine in the world in 100 years.\" The following month, a report by Save the Children estimated that 85,000 children under the age of five have died from starvation.This question asks: Before 1 January 2022, how many people will be credibly estimated to have died as a result of the famine in Yemen, with that estimate provided by a major international organization such as the United Nations or UNICEF?In case the relevant study has a quantified level of uncertainty in the form of a distribution, we shall take the median as the point estimate of the number of deaths.

On April 21st 2022, China recorded more than 30,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to Our World In Data, when recorded as a 7-day rolling average. Despite the existence of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, Chinese government officials continue to insist on a strategy of suppressing the virus through repeated lockdowns, which many around the world have described as draconian.  An article for Project Syndicate states,  > For most of the past two years, China\u2019s \u201czero-COVID\u201d strategy was seen as a drastic but effective way to maintain impressively low infection rates. The Chinese government locked down millions of people at a time, ordering them to stay in their homes \u2013 or even in schools and office buildings. Last winter, the city of Xi\u2019an was locked down for an entire month. All of its 13 million residents were confined to their homes, where they had minimal access to necessities such as food.  > Although this extreme strategy has had negative unintended consequences \u2013 including restricted medical care for other illnesses, separated families, and various other economic and social disruptions \u2013 it did keep COVID-19 infection rates low. Most people in China, and many observers elsewhere, viewed the costs as a worthwhile price to pay for sparing the broader population of 1.4 billion from the high mortality rates seen in countries like the United States.  However, some have speculated that China will soon abandon its zero-COVID strategy, after which the nation will experience a surge in cases, like those seen in Australia and Taiwan.",

Energy is a $8.5 trillion energy industry. It also doesn't emit greenhouse gases (once built), and its residue has a half-life of a few hundred years (much less than nuclear fission). (source) It's also safer as it seems the fusion reactor would be incapable of generating the dangerous runaway chain reactions that lead to a meltdown (source).  On the other hand, \"fusion reactors have other serious problems that also afflict today's fission reactors, including neutron radiation damage and radioactive waste, potential tritium release, the burden on coolant resources, outsize operating costs, and increased risks of nuclear weapons proliferation\" (source). Also see: Pure fusion weapon \u2014 Wikipedia.  >The fusion energy gain factor, usually expressed with the symbol Q, is the ratio of fusion power produced in a nuclear fusion reactor to the power required to maintain the plasma in steady state. The condition of Q = 1, when the power being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is referred to as breakeven, or in some sources, scientific breakeven.  >The energy given off by the fusion reactions may be captured within the fuel, leading to self-heating. Most fusion reactions release at least some of their energy in a form that cannot be captured within the plasma, so a system at Q = 1 will cool without external heating. With typical fuels, self-heating in fusion reactors is not expected to match the external sources until at least Q = 5. If Q increases past this point, increasing self-heating eventually removes the need for external heating. At this point the reaction becomes self-sustaining, a condition called ignition. Ignition corresponds to infinite Q, and is generally regarded as highly desirable for practical reactor designs.  (source: Fusion energy gain factor)",

    "question": "When will Ethereum abandon proof of work?",
    "context": "Ethereum is a blockchain with smart contracts that has used proof of work as its consensus mechanism since its inception. Even since before its launch though, there have been plans to move to the more environmentally friendly proof of stake instead.  In July 2015, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin expected to move to proof of stake in 9\u201312 months. A few days later, a \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d was added to the go-ethereum client, which would make mining (required for the proof of work consensus protocol) unsustainable past a given time, to enforce the move to proof of stake. However a replacement consensus implementation was not ready in time, and the difficulty bomb has been delayed many times since (in 2017, 2018, and 2019). In May 2021, the difficulty bomb was delayed until December 2021.  Meanwhile there *has* been progress on the move to proof of stake. In October 2017, Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith introduced Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget, \u201ca proof of stake-based finality system which overlays an existing proof of work blockchain\u201d. On December 1st 2020, an adaptation of this idea launched, in the form of the \u201cbeacon chain\u201d. (See the first block, and this background story by Consensys.)

    "context": "The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States. Established pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases, such as suits between two or more states, and those involving ambassadors.  It also has ultimate (and largely discretionary) appellate jurisdiction over all federal court and state court cases that involve a point of federal constitutional or statutory law. The Court has the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution or an executive act for being unlawful. However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction.  The Court may decide cases having political overtones, but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide nonjusticiable political questions. Each year it agrees to hear about 100\u2013150 of the more than 7,000 cases that it is asked to review.  Because justices can serve for life, potentially spending decades on the Court, vacancies are relatively rare and are considered major political events in the United States.  According to federal statute, the Court consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices. Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed from office.  The most recent vacancy arose in 2020, when on September 18, 2020, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Judge Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to fill the vacancy that arose.",

As of June 2021, it is authorized for use in 66 other countries including India and Brazil. However, as of June 2021 it is not approved by the World Health Organization in its emergency use listing (EUL). Approval by WHO is important, for example, for people vaccinated with Sputnik V if they want to study in US schools or travel in places that require you to be vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine.  As of June 3, 2021 WHO lists Pfizer, Moderna, 3 variants of AstraZeneca, J&J, Sinopharm and Sinovac as being approved for emergency use. Sputnik V is in the pipeline, with additional data being processed and inspections held every month. There is no official anticipated decision date, however, there have been developments that indicate that the approval may come relatively soon:  From The Moscow Times: \"Right now, our specialists are in Russia and their mission here will be completed by June 4,\" WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge told TASS. \"That\u2019s when a report with recommendations that will be taken into account will be prepared,\" Kluge added on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.

From Reuters: \"Russia expects the World Health Organization (WHO) to approve the Sputnik V vaccine against coronavirus within two months, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which markets the vaccine, told Reuters.

It is common, for example, have a Python script that calls a routine written in C and compiled into machine code. Other languages (like Mathematica) are even higher-level.  Still, even a high-level language requires unambiguous specification of the steps required for the task at hand.    It would be much nicer to specify the desired *task* rather than exactly how to do it, i.e. to have systems that can *write* programs to specification.  Such systems have had limited success so far, but there are signs of significant progress.  This recent review, for example, mentions new efforts to \"induce\" programs from a large set of input-output pairs.  A paper by Neelakantan, Le, and Sutskever, for instance, introduce a \"Neural Programmer,\" which augments a neural network with a set of basic operations that the network can be trained to use to solve a task; they showed success in training the network to reproduce the action of a set of simple programs.  While machine learning (ML) systems like the Neural Programmer don't quite output (say) Python programs written to some specification, they do create a program to accomplish a particular task.  Given a system to translate a specification into a trainable task, and to translate the Neural Programmer's instruction list into a typical language, this may not be that far away, at least for simple programming tasks.

If and when a sufficient number of people receive these vaccines, in combination with immunity provided through naturally occurring antibodies among those previously infected, the population is expected to reach herd immunity.  Current research suggests that herd immunity for COVID-19 is expected when 60-70% of a population is immune to the virus, either through vaccination or past infection.  Early results from the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines suggest efficacy >90%.  Early research results also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 immunity is long-lasting and may be consistent with the long term immunity observed in SARS.  On November 22nd, Dr. Slaoui, leader of Operation Warp Speed, stated that he expects herd immunity to likely be achieved in May 2021.  > 70% or so of the population being immunized would allow for true herd immunity to take place, that is likely to happen somewhere in the month of May, or something like that based on our plans.  > *Dr. Slaoui, November 22nd, 2020*  However, vaccine hestitancy may be high, with 42% of Americans in late October 2020 saying they would be unwilling to take a SARS-CoV-2.",

    "context": "From Wikipedia:  > Elden Ring began development in early 2017 following the release of The Ringed City, a piece of downloadable content for Dark Souls III. As with Miyazaki's Souls games, Elden Ring will have the ability for players to create their own custom characters instead of playing as a fixed protagonist. Miyazaki also considered Elden Ring to be a more \"natural evolution\" to the Souls series, as the game will be much larger in scale compared to them, featuring an open world with new gameplay mechanics such as horseback riding and combat. However, unlike many other open world games, Elden Ring will not feature populated towns with non-player characters, with the world having numerous dungeon-like ruins in place of them instead. When asked about the possibility of the story being novelized, Miyazaki stated that he would rather have players experience it themselves by playing the game, as he thinks that the game's secrets and mysteries would be spoiled otherwise. The score is being written by Yuka Kitamura, who has composed for many of Miyazaki's previous games.  As of the creation of this question (December 2020), no gameplay footage for Elden Ring has been released.",

    "context": "In August 2021, Australia reached a new peak in daily confirmed new Covid-19 cases, surpassing its previous peak set in August 2020.  As of 19 August 2021, Australia's two biggest cities and its capital territory are in lockdown and several other states and regions have recently emerged from their own lockdowns. International travel remains heavily restricted, and the number of travellers allowed into the country has been halved from 6,370 to 3,070 per week.  Under current government policy, vaccination rates will determine when international travel restrictions are loosened and when lockdowns become less likely. At the end of July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet announced a 'Phase B' target of 70% of the eligible population fully vaccinated, and a 'Phase C' target of 80%. In Phase C, the government seeks to \"minimise cases without lockdowns\", enact only \"highly targeted lockdowns\", \"abolish caps on returning vaccinated Australians\", \"lift all restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians\" and \"allow increased capped entry of student, economic, and humanitarian visa holders\", among other relaxations in restrictions.  As of August 19 2021, just over 28% of the eligible population (those aged at least 16) have been fully vaccinated. According to The Guardian, the 80% national target will be reached by the end of November if the the rate of new vaccinations remains fixed at its rate over the past 7 days. However, the experience of other countries has shown that this rate can slow considerably before reaching 80% of the adult population.  For a particular state or territory to enter 'Phase C', the 80% target must be reached in that state or territory as well as in the country as a whole. This question therefore asks about when target will be reached in Australia as a whole as well as in at least half of its states and territories.",

WeRide made its pilot appearance in Guangzhou, China in November 2020, launching their Robo-Taxis for customer use over 144.65 km of area in the city. These cars are fully autonomous, in that they can successfully drive paying customers using AI technology without the presence of any safety staff on board in case of an accident.  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) through their AV Test Initiative, California is one of the largest hotspots of activity for autonomous vehicle testing in the United States. There are currently over 80 companies testing autonomous vehicles within the US, although only 20 have submitted safety information to the NHTSA and registered with the AV Test Initiative. WeRide, who has access to test their vehicles in Silicon Valley with a driver on board, completed a highway test drive of over 50 km in 2019. However, only five companies (Cruise, Waymo, Nuro, Zoox, and AutoX) are allowed to deploy autonomous vehicles on public roads without a safety driver in California.   As WeRide progresses in China and proves the capabilities of its AI technology, it could be one of the next companies to secure a permit from the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) to test their fully autonomous vehicles in California on public roads without any company safety personnel on board.   Predictions should reflect the date that WeRide obtains a permit from the CPUC to test their driverless cars in California. There is a current list here.

Due to community spread of the virus throughout the United States and other countries, there has been interest in developing a vaccine to hopefully stop the spread of the virus.  In November 2020, Pfizer and Moderna announced their COVID-19 vaccines were more than 90% effective according to early trial data. Both vaccines require two doses per person. Government officials expect there to be 40 million doses from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine available in 2020 if both vaccines are approved, enough to vaccinate 20 million people. (*Washington Post*) By the end of 2021, Pfizer estimates it will be able to produce 1.3 billion doses, and Moderna estimates it will be able to produce 1 billion doses. (*The Guardian*)  Based on a chart from an analysis by McKinsey, a 90% effective vaccine covering 50% of the population, along with an additional ~15% natural immunity level, may be sufficient to achieve herd immunity. This model assumes that immunity is reached when the immune population reaches 58%, calculated from the expression 1 \u2212 1/R\u2080, where R\u2080 is 2.4.",

Trikafta is marketed at around $300,000. However, the initial evidence is that it is much more effective at improving lung function in CF patients than previous therapies.(4)Because of the cost of Orkambi, NICE, the organisation responsible for evaluating drugs affordability and effectiveness decided that the drug did not meet its quality of life standards and recommended not fund it.(5) NHS England and Vertex then negotiated to get a deal to reduce the price, but it took until October 2019 for NHS England to reach a deal to make Orkambi available to all eligible CF patients.(6) This question asks:When will Trikafta become available for Cystic Fibrosis patients on the NHS (England)?By 'available for Cystic Fibrosis patients', we mean that there are at least 5535 English CF patients who must have access to Trikafta via the NHS.",

    "context": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA, or the Dow) is a stock market index that indicates the value of 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States, and how they have traded in the stock market during various periods of time. The Industrial portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. Along with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite, it is one of the most influential and scrutinized US equity indices.In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread around the world. By February 28 2020, over 85,000 infections had been confirmed worldwide, along with over 2,900 related deaths.The global spread of the virus spooked financial markets, and led to one of the most rapid selloffs in the history of public equity markets, with major US equity indices experiencing their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis.The Dow closed on February 12 2020 at an all-time high, at 29,551.42 points. By the close of trading on February 28 2020, it had fallen to 25,409.36 points.This question asks: When will the Dow Jones Industrial Average next close at a level of at least 29,551.42 points, the all-time high closing value previously achieved on February 12 2020?Resolution should cite credible press reports, or information from a financial trading platform or news service, indicating that the Dow has closed at or above 29,551.42 points.If the Dow Jones Industrial Average is discontinued or modified such that Metaculus administrators believe it is no longer reasonable to continue with this question, this question shall resolve ambiguously.Note that this question refers to the closing value of the Dow, not any intraday level reached.",

The canal offers watercraft a more direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas, thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London, for example, by approximately 8,900 kilometres (5,500 mi). It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez. Its length is 193.30 km (120.11 mi) including its northern and southern access-channels. In 2012, 17,225 vessels traversed the canal (an average of 47 per day).At 07:40 Eastern European Time on 23 March 2021, the Ever Given, a Golden-class container ship, one of the largest in the world, was passing through the Suez Canal on its way to Rotterdam from Tanjung Pelepas when it ran aground, turned sideways and blocked the canal, causing the canal to be impassable, and significantly disrupting international shipping.As of 24 March 2021, eight tugboats are working to re-float the vessel in collaboration with diggers removing sand from the side of the canal where the vessel is wedged.When will the Suez Canal blockage of March 2021 be cleared?This question resolves as the time and date the Suez Canal becomes navigable by commercial shipping vessels, as reported by a major news organization (e.g. AP, Reuters, BBC, CNN, etc.).ETA (26 March): Ships with a beam of at least 20 meters must be able to pass the canal for this question to resolve positively.",

    "context": "The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) regularly polls the Hong Kong population and publishes survey results on various questions. It was previously known as the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme (HKUPOP), but became independent from the university in 2019.One of these is the \"People's Satisfaction with the Current Political Condition\", which reports answers to the question:With possible answers: Very positive / Quite positive / Half-half / Quite negative / Very negative / Don't Know or Hard to Say.The median satisfaction is defined as the lowest satisfaction such that 50% of respondents who expressed an opinion (i.e. excluding \"Don't know\" or \"Hard to Say\") are at least that satisfied. For example in March 2019, the answers were: 3.6% / 13.3% / 13.9% / 29.8% / 32.2% / 7.1%. So the median satisfaction was \"Quite negative\" (32.2 + 29.8 = 62.0 > (100-7.1)/2= 46.45).The median satisfaction has been \"Very negative\" since June 2019. This has only happened in October 2016 and February 2016.Question: When will the above-defined median satisfaction of Hongkongers with the political condition in Hong Kong be \"Quite negative\" or better?This will close and resolve retroactively to the lowest day in the \"Date of survey\" column for any survey results after July 2019 that satisfies the criteria.This resolves ambiguous if HKPORI does not publish relevant survey results for 3 months in a row prior to August 2019 for any reason, or if they change their methodology in a way that makes the results not comparable with previous values (as judged by a Metaculus admin), or if their results are not trustworthy anymore (as judged by a Metaculus admin).Importantly, this does not resolve ambiguous if HKPORI merely changes name / organisation, similar to when it transitioned from HKUPOP.This resolves to > 2020-08-31 on the 30th if September 2020 if it has not resolved yet (either normally or ambiguously).",

    "context": "Cryothanasia is the combination of euthanasia and cryopreservation. It involves a practitioner intentionally ending someone's viable life and cryopreserving some part of their body (most importantly the head) soon after.Proponents of cryothanasia consider the act to be more likely to result in a successful cryopreservation than in typical cryonics where practicioners have to wait for the declaration of legal death before cooling the body. It is hypothesized by some that by delaying the process of cryopreservation, the current practice of cryonics is unable to adequately preserve enough information for revival to be possible in the future. Cryothanasia is therefore a more ideal option for patients looking to be preserved in ideal conditions.Since Alcor is located in Arizona, and assisted suicide (much less euthanasia) is illegal under Arizona law, it is not currently possible for Alcor patients to receive cryothanasia. When will this cease to be the case?Alcor is said to perform cryothanasia if a member was legally euthanized and began the process of receiving cryoprotectants (or fixatives) very quickly after legal death was declared (<25 minutes). Since Alcor releases patient case reports describing how soon the vitrification procedure began after legal death was declared, it should be possible to determine whether Alcor is at some point meeting this standard. The date of resolution is the date during which the person in the relevant case report was legally declared dead (of was deanimated, in case of some controversy about the definition of legal death).If this does not resolve prior to 2099-12-18 this question resolves as \"> Dec 18, 2099\".",

    "question": "When will the first 49+ qubit universal quantum computer be constructed?",
    "context": "Quantum computation is a steadily-improving technology with vast promise that is arguably poised to take off in the next decade or two and potentially revolutionize a number of fields.Quantum computers exploit quantum effects of entanglement and superposition in systems acting as \"qubits\" (quantum bits) to efficiently perform calculations that are inefficient using classical computers. Most famous is the ability to factor very large numbers, the difficulty of which underlies many current cryptography systems. But there is much more: quantum computers could, for example, efficiently simulate quantum systems in chemistry and biology, leading to dramatically more powerful tools for designing materials, drugs, etc.The basic theory behind quantum computers is well understood, and computers with a handful of qubits have been created as of 2016. It is generally (though not universally) believed that only technological barriers exist to creating large-scale quantum computers.An interesting threshold is 50 qubits, at which quantum computers could outpace contemporary supercomputers in at least some applications. Google has recently stated a goal of a 49 (7x7 array) qubit device in 2018, and IBM has announced a similar goal.These goals may be \"ambitious\" but suggest that we may be years, rather than decades, away from general-purpose quantum computers. We ask:When will the first general-purpose quantum computer with > 48 qubits be constructed and operated to solve a computational problem?Resolution will occur via credible media or company report. Non-universal quantum computing systems (such as D-Wave's device) do not satisfy the criteria. The problem (e.g. prime factorization) need not be solved faster than any given classical computer, but must use the full 49+ qubit apparatus and be arguably nontrivial, e.g. use an algorithm that was developed specifically for quantum computation.",

As of 2017, the party was considered the \"largest party in Western Europe\" in terms of party membership, with more than half a million members.Labour is currently the Official Opposition in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, having won the second-largest number of seats in the 2017 general election.Jeremy Bernard Corbyn (born 26 May 1949) has been Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition since 2015. Corbyn was first elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North in 1983. Ideologically, he identifies himself as a democratic socialist. Taking the party to the left, he advocated renationalisation of public utilities and the railways, a less interventionist military policy, and reversals of austerity cuts to welfare and public services.After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a second leadership contest. Although critical of the European Union, he supported continued membership in the 2016 referendum. In the 2017 general election, Labour again finished as the second-largest party in parliament, but increased their share of the vote to 40%, resulting in a net gain of 30 seats and a hung parliament.Corbyn has been criticised for doing too little to address alleged antisemitism in the Labour Party and for alleged antisemitic associations prior to becoming leader. In February 2019, a number of Labour MPs quit the party and formed their own Independent Group in the Commons, largely in response to Corbyn's handling of allegations of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party, and his stance on Brexit.This question asks: When will Jeremy Corbyn cease to be Leader of the Labour Party?This question will resolve when Corbyn either resigns or is removed from the position of Leader of the Labour Party, steps down, or dies.

    "context": "Starcraft 2 (SC2) is a real time strategy computer game, first released in 2010.  In the ensuing years it has grown to be a major e-sport, with many professional competitions involving significant monetary prizes.  SC2 is characterized by continuous time play, a huge action space, partial observability of enemies, and long-term strategic play.  These qualities have made it very difficult for programmed or machine learning systems to match skilled human players.  (In competitions involving Starcraft 1, for example, human players routinely trounce bots).  Defeating a top human player would likely require some combination of:  * Super-human tactical combat control (placement of troops, unit composition, use of special abilities, etc.) * Super-human control of the economy (near optimal resource use, new more efficeint build orders, etc.) * Super-human overall strategic play. * Discovery of \"creative\" new build order, army compoisitions, strategies, etc. * An implicit or explicit ability to model the plans and actions of its opponent.  Recently, AI company Deepmind and Blizzard Entertainment announced a partnership to create a version of SC2 usable as an AI research environment, as well as facilitate the participation of AI players in the existing SC2 platform.

The system is noted for \"correlating well with human judgement\" and its metrics are widely used as a benchmark for scoring MT.  The current state-of-the-art for English-French MT using the BLEU scoring system is 40.56, set in 2017 by a team lead by Google Brain researchers with their Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), a massive neural network made up of thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. It was presented in this paper.
